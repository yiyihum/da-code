We could easily do this by controlling the `max_depth` or `min_samples_leaf` parameters. However I am personally not a fan of this approach. Instead I believe that by increasing the number of trees, we actually WANT individual trees to overfit on a particular subset of the training set - we then expect the ensembling (vote) to cancel this effect out. The only consideration is then the expected runtime since the algorithm is obviously **O(N)** w.r.t. the number of estimators.

On the other hand we see a much worse score for `Health` and `Science`. Perhaps we can connect those results with the metrics we observed during the [EDA](#eda) phase: `Entertainment` is by far the richest category with around **100,000 samples**, while `Health` is by far the poorest with less than **40,000**. As a result we might assume that the category itself is not in fact harder to predict - the problem is we have much fewer samples!\n","\n","## Conclusions\n","\n","Using some basic preprocessing and minimal tuning, we achieved some impressive metrics. This probably has to do with the high quality dataset we received - titles are clean and offer great predictive power into an article's category. \n","\n","### Improving Accuracy\n","If we cared about even higher metrics, we could consider a deep learning approach, for example using Keras. In fact those articles are probably hand labeled by a human which already leaks a minor error (I don't think that everyone would agree on those categories. For example what if an article discussed a new policy voted in the US congress and how this policy affects cancer research. Is that `Health` or `Politics`?) So our accuracy has an upper bound of human performance which could be around 95%. Does it make sense to use deep learning hoping to achieve a 3% improvement? \n","\n","Anyway, if we were to try deep learning, then we would be in good luck because Google has released pre-trained embeddings on a [google-news dataset](https://github.com/mmihaltz/word2vec-GoogleNews-vectors) - which means that those embeddings would probably serve as a great first hidden layer in any kind of recurrent architecture we might consider.

The authors of the original dataset opted for 4 categories, and I would assume this to be an educated guess.

Is that `Politics` or `Heath`?
