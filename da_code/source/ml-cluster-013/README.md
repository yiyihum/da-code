## About Dataset

## **Context**

The dataset provides socio-economic and health indicators for various countries. The goal is to classify countries based on these factors to determine which are in dire need of aid. This classification will help the International Humanitarian NGO's CEO make strategic and effective decisions on how to allocate the recently raised $10 million.
