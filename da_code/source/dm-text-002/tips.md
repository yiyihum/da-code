1. Population Projections

   $$
   P_t = P_0 \left(1 + \frac{r}{100}\right)^t$
   $$

- $t$ Number of years
- $P_t$ Population after \(t\) years
- $P_0$ Population at the start
- $r$ Growth annual rate (in %)

2. Growth Rate

   $$
   r = \left( \left( \frac{P_2}{P_1} \right)^{\frac{1}{t}} - 1 \right) \times 100
   $$

- $t$ Number of years of the period
- $P_2$: Population at the end of the period
- $P_1$ Population at the start of the period
- $r$ Growth annual rate (in %)
