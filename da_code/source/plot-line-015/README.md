### Sharpe Ratio

The Sharpe ratio, pioneered by William F. Sharpe, is a metric of risk-adjusted return. It is useful for determining how much risk is being taken to achieve a certain level of return. The formula for the Sharpe ratio is:

$$
S=\frac{R_a-r_f}{\sigma_a}
$$

Where:

- \( S \) = Sharpe Ratio
- \( R_a \) = Asset return
- \( r_f \) = Risk-free rate of return
- \( \sigma_a \) = Asset volatility
