### General Solution Approach

1. **Data Reading**: Use `pandas` to read the compressed CSV file containing odds data.
2. **Calculate Match Results**: Based on the scores of the home and away teams, calculate the match results and add them to the DataFrame.
3. **Calculate Probabilities**: Calculate the probabilities for each match outcome based on average odds.
4. **Compute Accuracy and Mean Probabilities**: Segment the probabilities into bins, and for each bin, calculate the observed match result probabilities and the mean predicted probabilities.
5. **Plot Results**: Use `matplotlib` to plot a scatter plot comparing the observed result probabilities with the predicted probabilities for visual analysis.

### Mathematical Expressions

1. **Match Result Calculation**:
   - Calculate goal difference \( \text{gol\_abs} \):
     \[
     \text{gol\_abs} = \text{home\_score} - \text{away\_score}
     \]
   - Determine the match result based on goal difference \( \text{result} \):
     \[
     \text{result} = 
     \begin{cases} 
     '1' & \text{if } \text{gol\_abs} > 0 \\
     'X' & \text{if } \text{gol\_abs} = 0 \\
     '2' & \text{if } \text{gol\_abs} < 0 
     \end{cases}
     \]

2. **Probability Calculation**:
   - Calculate probabilities based on odds \( p \):
     \[
     \text{prob1} = \frac{1}{\text{avg\_odds\_home\_win}}, \quad
     \text{probX} = \frac{1}{\text{avg\_odds\_draw}}, \quad
     \text{prob2} = \frac{1}{\text{avg\_odds\_away\_win}}
     \]

3. **Compute Accuracy and Mean Probabilities**:
   - Define bins \( \text{bins} \):
     \[
     \text{bins} = \{0, \frac{1}{n}, \frac{2}{n}, \ldots, 1\} \quad \text{(where \( n \) is the number of bins)}
     \]
   - For each bin, calculate observed probabilities and mean predicted probabilities:
     \[
     \text{mean\_obs} = \frac{\sum (\text{result} = \text{expected\_result})}{\text{total\_games\_in\_bin}}
     \]
     \[
     \text{mean\_cons} = \text{mean}(\text{prob})
     \]

4. **Plot Results**:
   - Use a scatter plot to compare observed result probabilities and mean predicted probabilities.

By following these steps, you can analyze match results and probabilities and validate the accuracy of the prediction model through visualization.
