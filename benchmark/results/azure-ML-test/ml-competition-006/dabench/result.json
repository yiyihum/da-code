You are now a contestant in this competition and need to design a method to predict the data in test.csv according to the competition requirements. Write the results into submission.csv according to the format of sample_submission.csv.\n",
  "system_message": "\n# CONTEXT #\nYou are a data scientist skilled in analyzing data from CSV, XLSX, and databases, proficient in using Bash commands and writing Python code to solve related problems. You should first understand the environment and conduct data analysis before handling the task. And you are now in a Bash environment equipped with all the necessary Python libraries and will start in the /workspace directory, which contains all the resources needed for the task. Please use the appropriate actions to select and analysis data to achieve the target.\n\n# OBJECTIVE #\n1. Interact with the environment and write Python code using specified actions in their predefined formats.\n2. Flexibly choose between Bash and Python code based on current needs. Bash is preferable for environment exploration and informed decision-making, while Python libraries such as pandas, scipy, and sklearn are effective for data analysis.\n3. Minimize the creation of unrelated files; ideally, write and edit all code in ONE Single Python (.py) file.\n\n# TASK REGUIREMENTS #\n1. Determine the nature of the task based on the task description and environmental information.\n2. For plotting tasks, write all code in 'Plot.py' using the matplotlib library, ensuring that the plotting code is not placed inside functions.\n3. For machine learning tasks, design and optimize your methods as much as possible, and verify that the final output format meets the task requirements or template requirements.\n\n# STYLE #\nFollow the writing style of data scientist assistant.\n\n# TONE #\nProfessional\n\n# AUDIENCE #\nIndividuals seeking to complete data-related tasks.\n\n# ACTION SPACE #\n\nAction: ExecuteCode(code=\"shell_command\")\nDescription: This action string will execute a valid shell command in the `code` field, such as `cat path/to/file.txt` and `python path/to/file.py`. Please pay attention to the current working directory. If you execute a `cd new_path` command, the working directory will be changed. If no further action is taken, the working directory will still be the changed new_path. Furthermore, for two special commands `cd new_path` and `export var=val`, they must occur as a single command and cannot use `&&` or `;` to chain together. If you want to, for example, set multiple environment variables, please use multiple ExecuteCode actions.\nUsage: ExecuteCode(code=\"ls -l\")\nObservation: The observation space is the stdout or stderr of the executed command in the bash terminal.\n\nAction: CreateFile(filepath=\"path/to/file\"):\n```\nfile_content\n```\nDescription: This action will create a file in the field `filepath` with the content wrapped by paired ``` symbols. Notice that, the file content can be free form text, arbitrary programming langugage codes or configurations. For more structured format (e.g., .csv or .json files), you can use the CreateFile action to firstly create a writing-to-file program file (e.g., .py or .sh) and then use the ExecuteCode action to execute the program and generate the structured file. Remember to provide the field `filepath` besides the \"file_content\" in this action even if the created file is only temporary and will be deleted later.\nUsage: CreateFile(filepath=\"hello_world.py\"):\n```\nprint(\"Hello, world!\")\n```\nObservation: The observation space is a text message indicating whether this action is executed successfully or not.\n\nAction: EditFile(filepath=\"path/to/file\"):\n```\nfile_content\n```\nDescription: This action will edit a file in the field `filepath` with the content wrapped by paired ``` symbols. Notice that, the file content can be free form text, arbitrary programming langugage codes or configurations. Normally, you need to read a file before deciding whether to use EditFile to modify it. You need to give the entire modified file content. \nUsage: EditFile(filepath=\"hello_world.py\"):\n```\nprint(\"Hello, world!\")\n```\nObservation: The observation space is a text message indicating whether this action is executed successfully or not.\n\nAction: Terminate(output=\"literal_answer_or_output_path\")\nDescription: This action denotes the completion of the entire task and returns the final answer or the output file/folder path. If the output field is a directory or filepath, you can use the relative path of the current working directory or directly use the absolute path.\nUsage1: Terminate(output=\"New York\")\nUsage2: Terminate(output=\"/workspace/result.txt\")\nUsage3: Terminate(output=\"FAIL\")\nObservation: The observation space is empty since the task is finished.\n\n\n# Notice #\n1. Fully understand the action space and its arguments before using it.\n2. Only use the action space when necessary, considering why the action is needed and whether the output will be too long to read.\n3. Check if the arguments you provided to the action space is correct in type and value.\n4. You can't take some problems for granted. For example, what's the content in the csv files, etc. But you can try to use the action space to solve the problem.\n5. If the function execution fails, you should analyze the error and try to solve it.\n\n\n\n# RESPONSE FROMAT # \nGiven the task input, your reponse at each turn should contain: \n1. Provide ONE single thought process that reasons about the current situation, prefixed with \"Thought: \". This could involve understanding file content and format, or inferring the output of a command or code.\n2. ONLY ONE action string in the ACTION SPACE (with prefix \"Action: \"). \n3. Each step may cross multiple lines, and you DO NOT need to generate the observation yourself, the environment will generate it for you.\n4. When you finish the task, respond with a Terminate action. However, before taking the Terminate action, ensure that all instructions have been met. For tasks that require file generation, verify that the files exist and their formats are correct.\n\nSuch that the interaction history is a sequence of interleaving Observation, Action and Thought steps that appear like this:\n\nObservation: ...\n\nThought: ...,\nAction: ...\n\nNow, let's start.\n\n  The user asked the following question: # TASK # \n \nThis is a dataset for a Wine Quality Prediction competition, with the description available in README.md.

      "observation": "## Overview\n\n**Welcome to the 2023 Kaggle Playground Series!** Thank you to everyone who participated in and contributed to Season 3 Playground Series so far!** **\n\n**Your Goal:** For this Episode of the Series, your task is to use regression to predict the quality of wine based on various properties. Good luck!\n\nStart\n\nJan 31, 2023\n\n###### Close\n\nFeb 14, 2023\n\n### Evaluation\n\nSubmissions are scored based on the quadratic weighted kappa, which measures the agreement between two outcomes. This metric typically varies from 0 (random agreement) to 1 (complete agreement). In the event that there is less agreement than expected by chance, the metric may go below 0.\n\nThe quadratic weighted kappa is calculated as follows. First, an N x N histogram matrix** ***O* is constructed, such that** ***O~i,j~* corresponds to the number of** **`Id`s** ***i* (actual) that received a predicted value** ** *j* . An** ***N-by-N** ***matrix of weights,** ** *w* , is calculated based on the difference between actual and predicted values:\n\n**\ud835\udc64**\ud835\udc56**,**\ud835\udc57**=**(**\ud835\udc56**\u2212**\ud835\udc57**)**2**(**\ud835\udc41**\u2212**1**)**2**\n\nAn** ***N-by-N* histogram matrix of expected outcomes,** ** *E* , is calculated assuming that there is no correlation between values.  This is calculated as the outer product between the actual histogram vector of outcomes and the predicted histogram vector, normalized such that** ***E* and** ***O* have the same sum.\n\nFrom these three matrices, the quadratic weighted kappa is calculated as:\n\n**\ud835\udf05**=**1**\u2212**\u2211**\ud835\udc56**,**\ud835\udc57**\ud835\udc64**\ud835\udc56**,**\ud835\udc57**\ud835\udc42**\ud835\udc56**,**\ud835\udc57**\u2211**\ud835\udc56**,**\ud835\udc57**\ud835\udc64**\ud835\udc56**,**\ud835\udc57**\ud835\udc38**\ud835\udc56**,**\ud835\udc57**.**\n\n## Submission File\n\nFor each** **`Id` in the test set, you must predict the value for the target** **`quality`. The file should contain a header and have the following format:\n\n```\nId,quality\n2056,5\n2057,7\n2058,3\netc.\n```\n\n# Wine Quality Dataset\n\n\n## About Dataset\n\n### Description:\n\nThis datasets is related to red variants of the Portuguese \"Vinho Verde\" wine.The dataset describes the amount of various chemicals present in wine and their effect on it's quality. The datasets can be viewed as classification or regression tasks. The classes are ordered and not balanced (e.g. there are much more normal wines than excellent or poor ones).Your task is to predict the quality of wine using the given data.\n\nA simple yet challenging project, to anticipate the quality of wine.\nThe complexity arises due to the fact that the dataset has fewer samples, & is highly imbalanced.\nCan you overcome these obstacles & build a good predictive model to classify them?\n\n**This data frame contains the following columns:**\n\nInput variables (based on physicochemical tests):\n1 - fixed acidity\n2 - volatile acidity\n3 - citric acid\n4 - residual sugar\n5 - chlorides\n6 - free sulfur dioxide\n7 - total sulfur dioxide\n8 - density\n9 - pH\n10 - sulphates\n11 - alcohol\nOutput variable (based on sensory data):\n12 - quality (score between 0 and 10)\n\n### Acknowledgements:\n\nThis dataset is also available from Kaggle & UCI machine learning repository,** \n[Observation too long, truncated; Try other actions to get the left part.]",
