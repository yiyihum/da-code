  "system_message": "\nYou are a helpful assitant who is expert at data analysis and processing.\nNow you will interact with a Bash environment to complete a data-related task. At the beginning, you are in the /workspace folder containing resources you need to solve the task.\nTo communicate with the environment, you can only use the following actions with pre-defined formats. After parsing and executing the action, the observation from the environment will be sent to you, such that you can take the next action in an interactive manner.\nPlease make your own decisions, explore your current environment, and make best use of the resources you have.\nHere are the definitions of each action, description, usage and observation:\n\n\nAction: ExecuteCode(code=\"shell_command\")\nDescription: This action string will execute a valid shell command in the `code` field, such as `cat path/to/file.txt` and `python path/to/file.py`. Please pay attention to the current working directory. If you execute a `cd new_path` command, the working directory will be changed. If no further action is taken, the working directory will still be the changed new_path. Furthermore, for two special commands `cd new_path` and `export var=val`, they must occur as a single command and cannot use `&&` or `;` to chain together. If you want to, for example, set multiple environment variables, please use multiple ExecuteCode actions.\nUsage: ExecuteCode(code=\"ls -l\")\nObservation: The observation space is the stdout or stderr of the executed command in the bash terminal.\n\nAction: CreateFile(filepath=\"path/to/file\"):\n```\nfile_content\n```\nDescription: This action will create a file in the field `filepath` with the content wrapped by paired ``` symbols. Notice that, the file content can be free form text, arbitrary programming langugage codes or configurations. For more structured format (e.g., .csv or .json files), you can use the CreateFile action to firstly create a writing-to-file program file (e.g., .py or .sh) and then use the ExecuteCode action to execute the program and generate the structured file. Remember to provide the field `filepath` besides the \"file_content\" in this action even if the created file is only temporary and will be deleted later.\nUsage: CreateFile(filepath=\"hello_world.py\"):\n```\nprint(\"Hello, world!\")\n```\nObservation: The observation space is a text message indicating whether this action is executed successfully or not.\n\nAction: EditFile(filepath=\"path/to/file\"):\n```\nfile_content\n```\nDescription: This action will edit a file in the field `filepath` with the content wrapped by paired ``` symbols. Notice that, the file content can be free form text, arbitrary programming langugage codes or configurations. Normally, you need to read a file before deciding whether to use EditFile to modify it. You need to give the entire modified file content. \nUsage: EditFile(filepath=\"hello_world.py\"):\n```\nprint(\"Hello, world!\")\n```\nObservation: The observation space is a text message indicating whether this action is executed successfully or not.\n\nAction: Terminate(output=\"literal_answer_or_output_path\")\nDescription: This action denotes the completion of the entire task and returns the final answer or the output file/folder path. If the output field is a directory or filepath, you can use the relative path of the current working directory or directly use the absolute path.\nUsage1: Terminate(output=\"New York\")\nUsage2: Terminate(output=\"/workspace/result.txt\")\nUsage3: Terminate(output=\"FAIL\")\nObservation: The observation space is empty since the task is finished.\n\n\nYour response must contain parsable Action. \nYour response at each turn must contain ONLY SINGLE ONE parsable action. When you finish the task, you must respond with a Terminate action.\n\n\nGiven the task input, your reponse at each turn should contain: 1) a thought process that reasons about the current situation (with prefix \"Thought: \"), and 2) an action string in the action space defined by the environment (with prefix \"Action: \"). Such that the interaction history is a sequence of interleaving Thought, Action and Observation steps that appear like this: (note that each step may cross multiple lines, and you do not need to generate the observation string yourself, the environment will generate it for you)\n\nThought: ...\nAction: ...\n\nObservation: ...\n\nThought: ...\nAction: ...\n\nObservation: ...\n\nNow, let's start.\n\nYou are asked to complete the following task: I have a Spaceship Titanic dataset, with the dataset description available in README.md.

However, we will wait for the completion of our exploratory analysis to determine whether we should include or exclude these outliers from the data set. It should be noted that if they were unreasonable values, like age = 800 instead of 80, then it's probably a safe solution to fix it now. However, we want to be careful when changing the data from its original value, as an accurate model may need to be created.\r\nEnd: in those fields where there are null values or no data. Missing values can be bad because some algorithms don't know how to handle null values and won't work. While others like decision trees can handle null values. Thus, it is important to correct before we start modeling because we will be comparing and contrasting several models. There are two common methods: either remove the entry or fill in the missing value using reasonable input. It is not recommended to delete an entry, especially a large percentage of entries, unless it really is an incomplete entry. Instead, it's better to impute missing values. The basic methodology for qualitative data is imputation using mode. The basic methodology for quantitative data is imputation using mean, median, or mean + randomized standard deviation. An intermediate methodology is to use a basic methodology based on specific criteria; for example, average age by class or ship to port by fares and SES. There are more complex methodologies, but they should be compared to the base model before deployment to determine if complexity actually adds value. For this dataset, age will be imputed using the median, the cockpit attribute will be removed, and landing will be imputed using mode. Subsequent iterations of the model may change this decision to determine if it improves the accuracy of the model.\r\nCreate. Feature development is when we use existing features to create new features to determine if they provide new signals to predict our outcome. For this dataset, we will create a header function to determine if it played a role in survival.\r\nTransformation: Last but not least, we'll get to the formatting. There are no date or currency formats, but there are data type formats. Our categorical data is imported as objects, making the math difficult. For this dataset, we will convert the feature data types to categorical dummy variables.\r\n\r\nDevide them into multiple age groups.\r\nYou can also check they were travel solo or not, also can count their family size, which may help you to predict.",

It also recommends feature engineering such as creating a new feature for titles, dividing into age groups, and determining solo travelers or family size.
