You need to predict the likelihood of a heart attack for individuals in test.csv based on this dataset. Please fill in the prediction results in result.csv, following the provided template.",
  "system_message": "\nYou are a helpful assitant who is expert at data analysis and processing.\nNow you will interact with a Bash environment to complete a data-related task. At the beginning, you are in the /workspace folder containing resources you need to solve the task.\nTo communicate with the environment, you can only use the following actions with pre-defined formats. After parsing and executing the action, the observation from the environment will be sent to you, such that you can take the next action in an interactive manner.\nPlease make your own decisions, explore your current environment, and make best use of the resources you have.\nHere are the definitions of each action, description, usage and observation:\n\n\nAction: ExecuteCode(code=\"shell_command\")\nDescription: This action string will execute a valid shell command in the `code` field, such as `cat path/to/file.txt` and `python path/to/file.py`. Please pay attention to the current working directory. If you execute a `cd new_path` command, the working directory will be changed. If no further action is taken, the working directory will still be the changed new_path. Furthermore, for two special commands `cd new_path` and `export var=val`, they must occur as a single command and cannot use `&&` or `;` to chain together. If you want to, for example, set multiple environment variables, please use multiple ExecuteCode actions.\nUsage: ExecuteCode(code=\"ls -l\")\nObservation: The observation space is the stdout or stderr of the executed command in the bash terminal.\n\nAction: CreateFile(filepath=\"path/to/file\"):\n```\nfile_content\n```\nDescription: This action will create a file in the field `filepath` with the content wrapped by paired ``` symbols. Notice that, the file content can be free form text, arbitrary programming langugage codes or configurations. For more structured format (e.g., .csv or .json files), you can use the CreateFile action to firstly create a writing-to-file program file (e.g., .py or .sh) and then use the ExecuteCode action to execute the program and generate the structured file. Remember to provide the field `filepath` besides the \"file_content\" in this action even if the created file is only temporary and will be deleted later.\nUsage: CreateFile(filepath=\"hello_world.py\"):\n```\nprint(\"Hello, world!\")\n```\nObservation: The observation space is a text message indicating whether this action is executed successfully or not.\n\nAction: EditFile(filepath=\"path/to/file\"):\n```\nfile_content\n```\nDescription: This action will edit a file in the field `filepath` with the content wrapped by paired ``` symbols. Notice that, the file content can be free form text, arbitrary programming langugage codes or configurations. Normally, you need to read a file before deciding whether to use EditFile to modify it. You need to give the entire modified file content. \nUsage: EditFile(filepath=\"hello_world.py\"):\n```\nprint(\"Hello, world!\")\n```\nObservation: The observation space is a text message indicating whether this action is executed successfully or not.\n\nAction: Terminate(output=\"literal_answer_or_output_path\")\nDescription: This action denotes the completion of the entire task and returns the final answer or the output file/folder path. If the output field is a directory or filepath, you can use the relative path of the current working directory or directly use the absolute path.\nUsage1: Terminate(output=\"New York\")\nUsage2: Terminate(output=\"/workspace/result.txt\")\nUsage3: Terminate(output=\"FAIL\")\nObservation: The observation space is empty since the task is finished.\n\n\nYour response must contain parsable Action. \nYour response at each turn must contain ONLY SINGLE ONE parsable action. When you finish the task, you must respond with a Terminate action.\n\n\nGiven the task input, your reponse at each turn should contain: 1) a thought process that reasons about the current situation (with prefix \"Thought: \"), and 2) an action string in the action space defined by the environment (with prefix \"Action: \"). Such that the interaction history is a sequence of interleaving Thought, Action and Observation steps that appear like this: (note that each step may cross multiple lines, and you do not need to generate the observation string yourself, the environment will generate it for you)\n\nThought: ...\nAction: ...\n\nObservation: ...\n\nThought: ...\nAction: ...\n\nObservation: ...\n\nNow, let's start.\n\nYou are asked to complete the following task: I have a dataset for predicting heart attack occurrences, with the dataset description available in README.md. You need to predict the likelihood of a heart attack for individuals in test.csv based on this dataset. Please fill in the prediction results in result.csv, following the provided template.",

However, within the current environment, I might not be able to perform complex computations or use machine learning libraries. If that's the case, I would likely have to simulate a basic prediction model or reuse pre-trained model coefficients if they are available.\n\nFor now, let's take a look at the heart.csv file to get a sense of the data.\n\nAction: ExecuteCode(code=\"head heart.csv\")"
