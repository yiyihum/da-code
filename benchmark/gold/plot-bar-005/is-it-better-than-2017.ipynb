I must say that when I was filling up the survey form, I got very excited. The questions were very much focused on different aspects as usual. Although I am expecting things to be in a better state as compared to the previous survey done in 2017, only data speaks the truth! \n \nI am going to analyze each question to the depth it demands. This is going to be a huge notebook with lots of code in it. If you are up for learning something new, sit tight and read thoroughly. Let's deep dive into the results and check what the results have to say!\n\n![yay](http://media.giphy.com/media/3o6fIZP7rywPQyEV44/giphy.gif)"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"bfaf5a9dd4ade64d4c12c4d6533517dce2c40834"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id=\"contents\"></a>\n# Contents\n1.

I am literally in shock. Here is the comparison:\n\n| Gender       | 2017           | 2018  |\n| :-------------|:-------------|: -----|\n| Male           | 81.88%        | 81.44%|\n| Female       | 16.71%          | 16.81%|\n| Others        | <2%            |  <2%  |\n\nYou might argue that the comparison is not completely fair as the number of respondents is not equal in both the cases. The numbers have grown from 2017 but the ratio is still almost the same. To give a fair comparison and how the numbers have grown since 2017, take a look at the table below:\n\n| Gender       | 2017          | 2018  |Change(%)|\n| :-------------|:-------------|: -----|---------|\n| Male           |~14K         |~20K   | ~43%    |\n| Female         |~2.8K        |~4K    | ~43%    |\n\nHence the overall ratio is almost the same. It is good that the numbers in the case of females have increased but it is not enough. \n\n**To the World**: We need to do more. We can't remove `bias` just by saying, a collective effort is required.

Although all three are different, I didn't expect such a huge gap between them. If you a little attebtion to the above plot, the difference between a business analyst and a Data Engineer is negligible but data analyst is leading by a huge margin than the other two.\n\nThere are two things worth noting down:\n* What all roles are included in `Software Engineer`? For example, in India, a software engineer but can be working as a Machine Learning Engineer, or a web developer or a mobile app developer. The same goes for `Research Scientist`. A research engineer in India can be a Machine Learning Engineer or someone who is just looking for more papers. It would have been better if there were more explicit optiond in the form.\n\n* The term `Data Scientist` means data scientist only or is it a broad term used to combine data scientist with ML engineers? Although the work is very much similar in some aspects, in my opinion, a machine learning engineer is also worried about putting things in production, that too under certain constraints. \n\n[(Click here to go to the contents section at the top)](#contents)"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"7c7c04e77d74d0f88a2d7b32cdc74e9e085a45e9"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id=\"experience\"></a>\n## 4.8 Experience in current role\n\nQ8: How many years of experience do you have in your current role?"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"90e47760e530c3ae0f7dff5c147119dc663d55be"},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Select the column for the corresponding question\nexp_df = multiChoiceResp['Q8'][1:].dropna()\n\nf,ax=plt.subplots(figsize=(10,5))\n\n# Order in which we want the plot to ensure readability \norder= ['0-1', '1-2', '2-3', '3-4', '4-5', '5-10', '10-15', '15-20', '20-25', '25-30', '30+']\n\n\n# Do countplot \nax=sns.countplot(exp_df,order=order, orient='v', color=color[4])\n\n# Plot percentage on the bars\npct_on_bars(ax, exp_df, orientation='v', offset=50,adjustment=2)\n\n    \nplt.xlabel('Experience (in years)')\nplt.ylabel('Respondents count')\nplt.title('Years of experience in current role')\nplt.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"6d1cb489ee93735d2fc545c8beb79ee4738dbf72"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Given the fact that the maximum number of respondents are students, the first column doesn't give much of insight as in some way it was expected that the percentage of `0-1` years of experience would also be on a similar scale.

This shouldn't come as surprise. In fact, I expected it more. Even if you are not using scikit-learn for using any ML algorithm implementation, people still use it for doing five fold splits for validation, or the most basic train/test split, standardizing data, etc. Then there are algorithms like RandomForest in the library that is also used widely used.\n\n\n**Tensorflow and Keras**: Keras has always been the easiest path(in most of the cases) if you want to build things quickly. Tensorlfow has always been a pain for simple tasks whereas for production usage, tensorflow still dominates the market. One important thing to observe is that the number of Tensorflow users has dropped from **24% in 2017** to **15% in 2018**. No surprise why it has dropped, PyTorch!.The ease and flexibility of doing things in **PyTorch** are much more as compared to Tensorflow.\n\n* **A note to TF developers:** From the above stats, you should learn a lesson. A developers' responsibility is to build things in the way the end users want. What is important from your perspective may not be useful at all from an end users' perspective. Although with the ongoing `RFCs` for `TF2.0`, I expect things to improve, that doesn't mean that the developers should forget why someone switched from Keras/Tensorflow to PyTorch\n\n**PyToch**: PyTorch is catching up quickly. Let's see how it performs next year once TF2.0 comes out\n\n**Xgboost**: Xgboost has been one of the favorite libraries especially for almost all Kagglers.

The usage of Matplotlib is still dominant compared to other high-level libraries for graph objects in research papers. There is one thing that needs to be made crystal clear though. The respondent may not be using matplotlib directly for high-level objects but might be using it to tweak the basic graph objects. For example, in the above plot, I am not using matplotlib directly for creating the bar plot but I am using it to change the labels and title of the matplotlib figure object.\n\n**ggplot2** ggplot is among those libraries that actually follow the `Grammar of Graphics` concept. It is neat and the visualizations created using it are always eye-catching.\n\n**Seaborn** and **Plolty** are very useful high-level libraries for creating awesome visualizations. With plotly you can create some of the best interactive visualizations and if you look at the home page of that library, you will find that it supports multiple languages apart from Python. Seaborn is one of my favorite libraries when it comes to doing quick visualizations. With few lines of code, you can produce good visualizations. The only con with seaborn is that it doesn't support interactive visualization(**..yet**). \n\nApart from them, **D3.js** is also very good in terms of flexibility and complex visualizations. **Altair** is another good interactive visualization library. The downside with Altair is that the documentation show its usage only with tiny and clean examples which are good but there is no documentation for dealing with complex and big datasets. If **[Jake](https://github.com/jakevdp)** can provide a tutorial(in a single jupyter notebook) with a dataset like this one or any other competition involving tabular data from Kaggle, I think Altair can be in top five within a few months. \n\n[(Click here to go to the contents section at the top)](#contents)"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"0f2f231013a11375258704461351961d5cebe38d"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id=\"coding\"></a>\n## 4.16 How much data science people code actively?\n\nQ23.

I think this is a very lame excuse. If your work is important, how the world is going to believe you until unless your results are reproducible? Also, if you can't reproduce it, how is it different than just being **lucky**? I personally don't think that reproducibility is hard. If you make sure that you are taking care of things like `seed`, `rng` in your code, it is no big deal. I agree that the results can't be exactly the same but minute differences doesn't matter much (until unless it is SOTA). For example, in the real world, if a paper/code claims that they can achieve 90% accuracy with it and previous works were around 87-88%, even if I am getting 89% accuracy, I would be fine with it. Even 88.5% would work.\n\n**~19** of the respondents say that they **don't get enough incentives to share their work**. I understand that when you are underpaid and still you do amazing work, it gets frustrating sharing your work. It feels like that you are throwing away your work for nothing. But not everything has to be related to money. **If you feel, you have done good work, go and say it out loud.**\n\n**~14%** of the respondents think that reproducibility **requires too much of technical knowledge**. No, it doesn't require too much of technical knowledge but it requires you to know about all the things that could have biased your results. **Validation isn't just science, it's an art**.\n\n**10%** of the respondents are afraid that **others will use their work without giving proper credits**. *This one is a legitimate concern.* Almost all the time people talk about reproducibility but I have hardly seen anyone discussing acknowledgement. This is a reflection of your bad character as a data science person. **Acknowledging someone's work doesn't make you less capable, rather it shows that you respect the great work done by others**\n\n\n[(Click here to go to the contents section at the top)](#contents)"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"4cf19ecb006cfd1fcdcb05e87ef561289345034d"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id=\"conclusion\"></a>\n## 4.33 Conclusion"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"cb508cb2833ef83d4f447f5b79e383d8833e8927"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"That's all folks! I think we have analyzed all the important questions asked in this survey. I will conclude the main points here that we already discussed and analyzed in detail in the notebook:\n\n* Number of women working in Data Science has increased in 2018 but the growth is slow and we need to do more to remove the gender bias from this niche field.\n* Gender distribution in younger age-group is more pronounced and we need to address this before things get bad again.\n* Each country has the gender bias problem and the ratio is screwed in each and every country.\n* Number of respondents interested in getting Masters' degree has increased since 2017. \n* Most of the businesses have just started to explore Machine Learning and only a handful of them have deployed Machine Learning in production.\n* Python is the topmost preferred language for doing data science and machine learning and it is the most recommended one as well.\n* In terms of ML libraries, scikit-learn, Tensorflow, Keras, Xgboost and PyTorch are dominating over others\n* Russia is the country where most of the respondents are confident about considering themselves as a data scientist.\n* Numerical data, text data, tabular data, time-series data and image data are the kind of datasets most of the people deal with.\n* Coursera is the most popular online learning platform among the respondents.\n* Most of the people spend less than 10% of their project time in finding bias in dataset/algorithm. This is a bad habit and we need to teach people the importance of it.\n* More than 50% of the respondents believe that ML models aren't black boxes and their outputs can be interpreted.\n* Jupyter is the most popular IDE among all the respondents.\n* Kaggle Kernels are the most popular hosted notebooks.\n* Kaggle Datasets, Google Search and Google Dataset Search are the best sources to search for any kind of dataset.\n* Gathering, cleaning and visualizing data are the most expensive stages of a data science project.\n* Tabular databases like MySQL, PostgresSQL, etc dominate the database market.\n* A large group of respondents think that reproducibility is too time-consuming while others think that it requires too much of knowledge. Not giving proper credits to someone's work is another factor which drives people away from reproducibility.\n\n\nWe, as a data science community, are responsible(directly or indirectly) for all the things that are happening in this field and only we have the power to make things right. It is acceptable that not everyone can bring a big change but you can always raise your voice against wrong things. \n\n\nI hope you enjoyed the analysis and might have learnt something new about all the libraries I have used.
