Evaluation Criteria (evaluate)

When evaluating the results of an A/B test, you need to consider the following points:

P-Value:

If the P-value is less than 0.05, we have strong evidence to reject the null hypothesis (AB Hypothesis: "Strong Evidence To Reject NULL Hypothesis").
If the P-value is greater than or equal to 0.05, we do not have enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis (AB Hypothesis: "No Evidence To Reject NULL Hypothesis").

Test Type (test_type):

If both sets of data conform to the normal distribution, use a parametric test ("Parametric").
If any set of data does not conform to the normal distribution, use a non-parametric test ("Non Parametric").
Comment:

If we reject the null hypothesis, it means there are significant differences between groups A and B (Comment: "A/B Groups Are Not Similar").
If we do not reject the null hypothesis, it means there are no significant differences between groups A and B (Comment: "A/B Groups Are Similar").


Correct Answer Evaluation
Based on the correct answer you provided, let's evaluate it item by item:
'''
test_type: Non Parametric
AB Hypothesis: No Evidence To Reject NULL Hypothesis
P-Value: 0.9679139953914079
Comment: A/B Groups Are Similar
'''
P-Value:
The P-value in the result is 0.9679139953914079, which is greater than 0.05. This shows that there is not enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis, which is in line with our expectations.
Test Type (test_type):
Use non-parametric test (Non Parametric). This is because the data does not conform to the normal distribution, and using non-parametric test is the right choice.
Homogeneity Test (Homogeneity):
The correct answer does not mention the homogeneity test, which is also logical because non-parametric tests do not require variance homogeneity tests.
AB Hypothesis (AB Hypothesis):
The result shows "No Evidence To Reject NULL Hypothesis", that is, there is not enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis, which is consistent with the P value being greater than 0.05.
Comment (Comment):
The result shows "A/B Groups Are Similar", which is consistent with the conclusion that the null hypothesis was not rejected.
