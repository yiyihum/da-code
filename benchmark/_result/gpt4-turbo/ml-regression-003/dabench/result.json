You are working in a Bash environment with all necessary Python libraries installed. If you need to install additional libraries, you can use the 'pip install' command. You are starting in the /workspace directory, which contains all the data needed for your tasks. You can only use the actions provided in the ACTION SPACE to solve the task.\n\n# ACTION SPACE #\n\n## Bash Action\n* Signature: Bash(code=\"shell_command\")\n* Description: This action string will execute a valid shell command in the `code` field.\n* Example: Bash(code=\"ls -l\")\n\n## Python Action\n* Signature: Python(filepath=\"path/to/python_file\"):\n```python\nexecutable_python_code\n```\n* Description: This action will create a python file in the field `filepath` with the content wrapped by paired ``` symbols. If the file already exists, it will be overwritten. After creating the file, the python file will be executed. \n* Example: Python(file_name=\"./hello_world.py\"):\n```python\nprint(\"Hello, world!\")\n```\n\n## SQL Action\n* Signature: SQL(file_path=\"path/to/database_file\", command=\"sql_command\", output=\"path/to/output_file.csv\" or \"direct\")\n* Description: Executes an SQL command on the specified database file. If `output` is set to a file path, the results are saved to this CSV file; if set to 'direct', results are displayed directly.\n* Constraints:\n  - The database file must be accessible and in a format compatible with SQLite (e.g., .sqlite, .db).\n  - SQL commands must be valid and safely formatted to prevent security issues such as SQL injection.\n* Examples:\n  - Example1: SQL(file_path=\"data.sqlite\", command=\"SELECT name FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='table'\", output=\"directly\")\n  - Example2: SQL(file_path=\"data.db\", command=\"SELECT * FROM users\", output=\"users_output.csv\")\n\n\n## Terminate Action\n* Signature: Terminate(output=\"literal_answer_or_output_path\")\n* Description: This action denotes the completion of the entire task and returns the final answer or the output file/folder path. Make sure the output file is located in the initial workspace directory.\n* Examples:\n  - Example1: Terminate(output=\"New York\")\n  - Example2: Terminate(output=\"result.csv\")\n  - Example3: Terminate(output=\"FAIL\")\n\n\n\n# NOTICE #\n1.

      "observation": "### **Problem:**\n\nThere are many seasons that sales are significantly higher or lower than averages. If the company does not know about these seasons, it can lose too much money. Predicting future sales is one of the most crucial plans for a company. Sales forecasting gives an idea to the company for arranging stocks, calculating revenue, and deciding to make a new investment. Another advantage of knowing future sales is that achieving predetermined targets from the beginning of the seasons can have a positive effect on stock prices and investors' perceptions. Also, not reaching the projected target could significantly damage stock prices, conversely. And, it will be a big problem especially for Walmart as a big company.\n\n### **Aim:**\n\nMy aim in this project is to build a model which predicts sales of the stores. With this model, Walmart authorities can decide their future plans which is very important for arranging stocks, calculating revenue and deciding to make new investment or not.\n\n### **Solution:**\n\nWith the accurate prediction company can;\n\n* Determine seasonal demands and take action for this\n* Protect from money loss because achieving sales targets can have a positive effect on stock prices and investors' perceptions\n* Forecast revenue easily and accurately\n* Manage inventories\n* Do more effective campaigns\n\n### **Plan:**\n\n1. Understanding, Cleaning and Exploring Data\n2. Preparing Data to Modeling\n3. Random Forest Regressor\n4. ARIMA/ExponentialSmooting/ARCH Models\n\n### **Metric:**\n\nThe metric of the competition is weighted mean absolute error (WMAE). Weight of the error changes when it is holiday.** **\n\n***Understanding, Cleaning and Exploring Data:*** The first challange of this data is that there are too much seasonal effects on sales. Some departments have higher sales in some seasons but on average the best departments are different. To analyze these effects, data divided weeks of the year and also holiday dates categorized.\n\n***Preparing Data to Modeling:*** Boolean and string features encoded and whole columns encoded.** **\n\n***Random Forest Regressor:*** Feature selection was done according to feature importance and as a best result 1801 error found.** **\n\n***ARIMA/ExponentialSmooting/ARCH Models:*** Second challange in this data is that it is not stationary. To make data more stationary taking difference,log and shift techniques applied. The least error was found with ExponentialSmooting as 821.\n\n### **Findings:**\n\n* Although some departments has higher sales, on average others can be best. It shows us, some departments has effect on sales on some seasons like Thanksgiving.\n* It is same for stores, means that some areas has higher seasonal sales.** **\n* Stores has 3 types as A, B and C according to their sizes. Almost half of the stores are bigger than 150000 and categorized as A. According to type, sales of the stores are changing.\n* As expected, holiday average sales are higher than normal dates.\n* Top 4 sales belongs to Chris\n[Observation too long, truncated; Try other commands to get the left part.]",

The goal is to predict weekly sales for Walmart stores, taking into account seasonal effects, holidays, and other factors. The metric for evaluating the model's performance is the weighted mean absolute error (WMAE), with a higher weight given to errors during holiday weeks. The README mentions that the data needs to be cleaned and explored, and that various models such as Random Forest Regressor and time series models like ARIMA, Exponential Smoothing, and ARCH will be considered.\n\nBefore proceeding with data preparation and modeling, I need to explore the dataset to understand its structure, the features available, and any preprocessing that might be required. I should list the files in the current directory to identify the dataset files and any other relevant files that might be used for the analysis.\n\nAction: Bash(code=\"ls -l\")",

The `test.csv` dataset also has no missing values in the columns provided.

Since the `train.csv` and `test.csv` files contain the Store, Dept, and Date columns, these can be used as keys to merge with the `features.csv` and `stores.csv` datasets.
