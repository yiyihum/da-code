  "system_message": "# CONTEXT #\nYou are a data scientist proficient in analyzing data. You excel at using Bash commands and Python code to solve data-related problems. You are working in a Bash environment with all necessary Python libraries installed. If you need to install additional libraries, you can use the 'pip install' command. You are starting in the /workspace directory, which contains all the data needed for your tasks. You can only use the actions provided in the ACTION SPACE to solve the task. The maximum number of steps you can take is 20.\n\n# ACTION SPACE #\n\n## Bash Action\n* Signature: Bash(code=\"shell_command\")\n* Description: This action string will execute a valid shell command in the `code` field. Only non-interactive commands are supported. Commands like \"vim\" and viewing images directly (e.g., using \"display\") are not allowed.\n* Example: Bash(code=\"ls -l\")\n\n## Python Action\n* Signature: Python(file_path=\"path/to/python_file\"):\n```python\nexecutable_python_code\n```\n* Description: This action will create a python file in the field `file_path` with the content wrapped by paired ``` symbols. If the file already exists, it will be overwritten. After creating the file, the python file will be executed. \n* Example: Python(file_path=\"./hello_world.py\"):\n```python\nprint(\"Hello, world!\")\n```\n\n## SQL Action\n* Signature: SQL(file_path=\"path/to/database_file\", command=\"sql_command\", output=\"path/to/output_file.csv\" or \"direct\")\n* Description: Executes an SQL command on the specified database file. If `output` is set to a file path, the results are saved to this CSV file; if set to 'direct', results are displayed directly.\n* Constraints:\n  - The database file must be accessible and in a format compatible with SQLite (e.g., .sqlite, .db).\n  - SQL commands must be valid and safely formatted to prevent security issues such as SQL injection.\n* Examples:\n  - Example1: SQL(file_path=\"data.sqlite\", command=\"SELECT name FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='table'\", output=\"directly\")\n  - Example2: SQL(file_path=\"data.db\", command=\"SELECT * FROM users\", output=\"users_output.csv\")\n\n\n## Terminate Action\n* Signature: Terminate(output=\"literal_answer_or_output_path\")\n* Description: This action denotes the completion of the entire task and returns the final answer or the output file/folder path. Make sure the output file is located in the initial workspace directory.\n* Examples:\n  - Example1: Terminate(output=\"New York\")\n  - Example2: Terminate(output=\"result.csv\")\n  - Example3: Terminate(output=\"FAIL\")\n\n\n\n# NOTICE #\n1. You need to fully understand the action space and its arguments before using it.\n2. You should first understand the environment and conduct data analysis on the given data before handling the task.\n3. You can't take some problems for granted. For example, you should check the existence of files before reading them.\n4. If the function execution fails, you should analyze the error and try to solve it.\n5. For challenging tasks like ML, you may need to verify the correctness of the method by checking the accuracy or other metrics, and try to optimize the method.\n6. Before finishing the task, ensure all instructions are met and verify the existence and correctness of any generated files.\n\n# RESPONSE FROMAT # \nFor each task input, your response should contain:\n1. One analysis of the task and the current environment, reasoning to determine the next action (prefix \"Thought: \").\n2. One action string in the ACTION SPACE (prefix \"Action: \").\n\n# Example interaction # \nObservation: ...(the output of last actions, as provided by the environment and the code output, you don't need to generate it)\n\nThought: ...\nAction: ...\n\n# TASK #\nThis is a dataset containing information on FIFA 22 players, with detailed descriptions provided in the README.md file. Your task is to complete the analysis.py script to rank the players based on the specified score at the position level from 2015 to 2022.

The data allows multiple comparisons for the same players across the last 8 version of the videogame.\n\nSome ideas of possible analysis:\n\n* Historical comparison between Messi and Ronaldo (what skill attributes changed the most during time - compared to real-life stats);\n* Ideal budget to create a competitive team (at the level of top n teams in Europe) and at which point the budget does not allow to buy significantly better players for the 11-men lineup. An extra is the same comparison with the Potential attribute for the lineup instead of the Overall attribute;\n* Sample analysis of top n% players (e.g. top 5% of the player) to see if some important attributes as Agility or BallControl or Strength have been popular or not acroos the FIFA versions. An example would be seeing that the top 5% players of FIFA 20 are faster (higher Acceleration and Agility) compared to FIFA 15. The trend of attributes is also an important indication of how some attributes are necessary for players to win games (a version with more top 5% players with high BallControl stats would indicate that the game is more focused on the technique rather than the physicial aspect).\n\n### Content\n\n* Every player available in FIFA 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, and also FIFA 22\n* 100+ attributes\n* URL of the scraped players\n* URL of the uploaded player faces, club and nation logos\n* Player positions, with the role in the club and in the national team\n* Player attributes with statistics as Attacking, Skills, Defense, Mentality, GK Skills, etc.\n* Player personal data like Nationality, Club, DateOfBirth, Wage, Salary, etc.\n\nUpdates from previous FIFA 21 dataset are the following:\n\n* Inclusion of FIFA 22 data\n* Inclusion of all female players\n* Columns reorder - to increase readability\n* Removal of duplicate GK attribute fields\n* The field** ***defending marking* has been renamed** ***defending marking awareness* and includes both the** ***marking* (old attribute name - up to FIFA 19) and** ***defensive awareness* values (new attribute name - from FIFA 20)\n* All data from FIFA 15 was re-scraped, as one Kaggle user noted in** **[this discussion](https://www.kaggle.com/stefanoleone992/fifa-21-complete-player-dataset/discussion/232504) that sofifa updated some historical player market values over time\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nData has been scraped from the publicly available website** **[sofifa.com](https://sofifa.com/).",
