You are working in a Bash environment with all necessary Python libraries installed. If you need to install additional libraries, you can use the 'pip install' command. You are starting in the /workspace directory, which contains all the data needed for your tasks. You can only use the actions provided in the ACTION SPACE to solve the task.\n\n# ACTION SPACE #\n\n## Bash Action\n* Signature: Bash(code=\"shell_command\")\n* Description: This action string will execute a valid shell command in the `code` field.\n* Example: Bash(code=\"ls -l\")\n\n## Python Action\n* Signature: Python(filepath=\"path/to/python_file\"):\n```python\nexecutable_python_code\n```\n* Description: This action will create a python file in the field `filepath` with the content wrapped by paired ``` symbols. If the file already exists, it will be overwritten. After creating the file, the python file will be executed. \n* Example: Python(file_name=\"./hello_world.py\"):\n```python\nprint(\"Hello, world!\")\n```\n\n## SQL Action\n* Signature: SQL(file_path=\"path/to/database_file\", command=\"sql_command\", output=\"path/to/output_file.csv\" or \"direct\")\n* Description: Executes an SQL command on the specified database file. If `output` is set to a file path, the results are saved to this CSV file; if set to 'direct', results are displayed directly.\n* Constraints:\n  - The database file must be accessible and in a format compatible with SQLite (e.g., .sqlite, .db).\n  - SQL commands must be valid and safely formatted to prevent security issues such as SQL injection.\n* Examples:\n  - Example1: SQL(file_path=\"data.sqlite\", command=\"SELECT name FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='table'\", output=\"directly\")\n  - Example2: SQL(file_path=\"data.db\", command=\"SELECT * FROM users\", output=\"users_output.csv\")\n\n\n## Terminate Action\n* Signature: Terminate(output=\"literal_answer_or_output_path\")\n* Description: This action denotes the completion of the entire task and returns the final answer or the output file/folder path. Make sure the output file is located in the initial workspace directory.\n* Examples:\n  - Example1: Terminate(output=\"New York\")\n  - Example2: Terminate(output=\"result.csv\")\n  - Example3: Terminate(output=\"FAIL\")\n\n\n\n# NOTICE #\n1.

You can't take some problems for granted. For example, what's the content in the csv files, etc. But you can try to use the action space to solve the problem.\n3. If the function execution fails, you should analyze the error and try to solve it.\n4. Before finishing the task, ensure all instructions are met and verify the existence and correctness of any generated files.\n\n# RESPONSE FROMAT # \nFor each task input, your response should contain:\n1. One analysis of the task and the current environment, reasoning to determine the next action (prefix \"Thought: \").\n2. One action string in the ACTION SPACE (prefix \"Action: \").\n3.

This is our last episode for the Season 3 and we wish you all a Happy New Year! Stay tuned for the new season next year!\n\n**Your Goal:** For this Episode of the Series, your task is to use a multi-class approach to predict the the outcomes of patients with cirrhosis.

Each** **`id` in the test set had a single true class label,** **`Status`. For each** **`id`, you must submit a set of predicted probabilities for each of the three possible outcomes, e.g.,** **`Status_C`,** **`Status_CL`, and** **`Status_D`.\n\nThe metric is calculated\n\n**\ud835\udc59**\ud835\udc5c**\ud835\udc54**\ud835\udc59**\ud835\udc5c**\ud835\udc60**\ud835\udc60**=**\u2212**1**\ud835\udc41**\u2211**\ud835\udc56**=**1**\ud835\udc41**\u2211**\ud835\udc57**=**1**\ud835\udc40**\ud835\udc66**\ud835\udc56**\ud835\udc57**log**(**\ud835\udc5d**\ud835\udc56**\ud835\udc57**)**,**\n\nwhere** **\ud835\udc41** **is the number of rows in the test set,** **\ud835\udc40** **is the number of outcomes (i.e., 3), ** **\ud835\udc59**\ud835\udc5c**\ud835\udc54** **is the natural logarithm,** **\ud835\udc66**\ud835\udc56**\ud835\udc57** **is 1 if row** **\ud835\udc56** **has the ground truth label** **\ud835\udc57** **and 0 otherwise, and** **\ud835\udc5d**\ud835\udc56**\ud835\udc57** **is the predicted probability that observation** **\ud835\udc56** **belongs to class **\ud835\udc57**.\n\nThe submitted probabilities for a given row are not required to sum to one because they are rescaled prior to being scored (each row is divided by the row sum).

The survival states include 0 = D (death), 1 = C (censored), 2 = CL (censored due to liver transplantation).\n\n**For what purpose was the dataset created?**\n\nCirrhosis results from prolonged liver damage, leading to extensive scarring, often due to conditions like hepatitis or chronic alcohol consumption.
