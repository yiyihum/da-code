You are working in a Bash environment with all necessary Python libraries installed. If you need to install additional libraries, you can use the 'pip install' command. You are starting in the /workspace directory, which contains all the data needed for your tasks. You can only use the actions provided in the ACTION SPACE to solve the task.\n\n# ACTION SPACE #\n\n## Bash Action\n* Signature: Bash(code=\"shell_command\")\n* Description: This action string will execute a valid shell command in the `code` field.\n* Example: Bash(code=\"ls -l\")\n\n## Python Action\n* Signature: Python(filepath=\"path/to/python_file\"):\n```python\nexecutable_python_code\n```\n* Description: This action will create a python file in the field `filepath` with the content wrapped by paired ``` symbols. If the file already exists, it will be overwritten. After creating the file, the python file will be executed. \n* Example: Python(file_name=\"./hello_world.py\"):\n```python\nprint(\"Hello, world!\")\n```\n\n## SQL Action\n* Signature: SQL(file_path=\"path/to/database_file\", command=\"sql_command\", output=\"path/to/output_file.csv\" or \"direct\")\n* Description: Executes an SQL command on the specified database file. If `output` is set to a file path, the results are saved to this CSV file; if set to 'direct', results are displayed directly.\n* Constraints:\n  - The database file must be accessible and in a format compatible with SQLite (e.g., .sqlite, .db).\n  - SQL commands must be valid and safely formatted to prevent security issues such as SQL injection.\n* Examples:\n  - Example1: SQL(file_path=\"data.sqlite\", command=\"SELECT name FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='table'\", output=\"directly\")\n  - Example2: SQL(file_path=\"data.db\", command=\"SELECT * FROM users\", output=\"users_output.csv\")\n\n\n## Terminate Action\n* Signature: Terminate(output=\"literal_answer_or_output_path\")\n* Description: This action denotes the completion of the entire task and returns the final answer or the output file/folder path. Make sure the output file is located in the initial workspace directory.\n* Examples:\n  - Example1: Terminate(output=\"New York\")\n  - Example2: Terminate(output=\"result.csv\")\n  - Example3: Terminate(output=\"FAIL\")\n\n\n\n# NOTICE #\n1.

If the function execution fails, you should analyze the error and try to solve it.\n4. Before finishing the task, ensure all instructions are met and verify the existence and correctness of any generated files.\n\n# RESPONSE FROMAT # \nFor each task input, your response should contain:\n1.

However, we will wait for the completion of our exploratory analysis to determine whether we should include or exclude these outliers from the data set. It should be noted that if they were unreasonable values, like age = 800 instead of 80, then it's probably a safe solution to fix it now. However, we want to be careful when changing the data from its original value, as an accurate model may need to be created.\r\nEnd: in those fields where there are null values or no data. Missing values can be bad because some algorithms don't know how to handle null values and won't work. While others like decision trees can handle null values. Thus, it is important to correct before we start modeling because we will be comparing and contrasting several models. There are two common methods: either remove the entry or fill in the missing value using reasonable input. It is not recommended to delete an entry, especially a large percentage of entries, unless it really is an incomplete entry. Instead, it's better to impute missing values. The basic methodology for qualitative data is imputation using mode. The basic methodology for quantitative data is imputation using mean, median, or mean + randomized standard deviation. An intermediate methodology is to use a basic methodology based on specific criteria; for example, average age by class or ship to port by fares and SES. There are more complex methodologies, but they should be compared to the base model before deployment to determine if complexity actually adds value. For this dataset, age will be imputed using the median, the cockpit attribute will be removed, and landing will be imputed using mode. Subsequent iterations of the model may change this decision to determine if it improves the accuracy of the model.\r\nCreate. Feature development is when we use existing features to create new features to determine if they provide new signals to predict our outcome. For this dataset, we will create a header function to determine if it played a role in survival.\r\nTransformation: Last but not least, we'll get to the formatting. There are no date or currency formats, but there are data type formats. Our categorical data is imported as objects, making the math difficult. For this dataset, we will convert the feature data types to categorical dummy variables.\r\n\r\nDevide them into multiple age groups.\r\nYou can also check they were travel solo or not, also can count their family size, which may help you to predict.",

It mentions specific strategies for handling missing values and creating new features, as well as converting data types for categorical variables.
