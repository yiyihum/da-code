In this competition, we hope to foster open research and transparency on AI detection techniques applicable in the real world.\n\nThis competition challenges participants to develop a machine learning model that can accurately detect whether an essay was written by a student or an LLM. The competition dataset comprises a mix of student-written essays and essays generated by a variety of LLMs.\n\nStart\n\nNov 1, 2023\n\n###### Close\n\nJan 23, 2024\n\nMerger & Entry\n\n### Description\n\nlink\n\nkeyboard_arrow_up\n\nCan you help build a model to identify which essay was written by middle and high school students, and which was written using a large language model? With the spread of LLMs, many people fear they will replace or alter work that would usually be done by humans. Educators are especially concerned about their impact on students\u2019 skill development, though many remain optimistic that LLMs will ultimately be a useful tool to help students improve their writing skills.\n\nAt the forefront of academic concerns about LLMs is their potential to enable plagiarism. LLMs are trained on a massive dataset of text and code, which means that they are able to generate text that is very similar to human-written text. For example, students could use LLMs to generate essays that are not their own, missing crucial learning keystones. Your work on this competition can help identify telltale LLM artifacts and advance the state of the art in LLM text detection. By using texts of moderate length on a variety of subjects and multiple, unknown generative models, we aim to replicate typical detection scenarios and incentivize learning features that generalize across models.\n\nVanderbilt University, together with The Learning Agency Lab, an independent nonprofit based in Arizona, have collaborated with Kaggle on this competition** **\n\n### Acknowledgments\n\nVanderbilt University and the Learning Agency Lab would like to thank the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Schmidt Futures, and Chan Zuckerberg Initiative for their support in making this work possible.** **\n\n[![](https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-media/competitions/The%20Learning%20Agency/BMGF_logo_black_300dpi%20(1).jpg)         ](https://www.gatesfoundation.org/)[![](https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-media/competitions/The%20Learning%20Agency/Schmidt%20Futures%20Logo.png)        ](https://schmidtfutures.com/)[![](https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-media/competitions/The%20Learning%20Agency/1200px-Chan_Zuckerberg_Initiative.svg.png)         ](https://chanzuckerberg.com/)\n\n### Evaluation\n\nlink\n\nkeyboard_arrow_up\n\nSubmissions are evaluated on** **[area under the ROC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_operating_characteristic) curve between the predicted probability and the observed target.\n\n## Submission File\n\nFor each** **`id` in the test\n[Observation too long, truncated; Try other commands to get the left part.]",

It is an amazing thing to think if every person doesn't drive in one big city that it saves so much pollution going in to the air. Another thing to think about is if everyone in a city didn't drive and walked everywhere, more people would stay healthier by staying in shape. Some people think that owning a car is more stressful than just walking everywhere. If you don't own a car you don't have to pay for insurance, don't have to pay for gas, and don't have to pay for repairs when something goes wrong in a vehicle. To me it sounds like there is a lot of advantages in limiting car use.\n\nOne solid reason why not using cars as much is the pollution going in the air. In Paris, France motorists with even numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at their house or else they would be fined. The next day odd numbered license plates motorists had to leave their vehicles at home. It was a hardship at first to get people to follow these new rules, but after about five days everything started to cool down. The pollution had dropped 60 percent in Paris which is exactly what the city was looking for. Limiting the car usage didn't just save pollution from going in the air, but also there wasn't as much traffic as there usually was. It also made Paris a safer place to be outside and not damage the citizens lungs. The capital city of France also made transportation free MondayFriday to help the cause. Soon enough people that had both license plates could drive on the same day.\n\nIn Bogota, Colombia they do a car free day that is becoming popular in that part of the world. It is awesome to think there are 7 million people in that city and none of them are using a car. People that violated this goal on this day were charged a 25 fine. People from other countries came to see how this day worked and they loved it. The mayor of Asuncion, Paraguay said \"\"These people are generating a revolutionary change, and this is crossing borders.\"\" You can just imagine all the benefits of everyone not using a car in a city for a whole day. Restaurants and parks would be visited and used more and everyone would be getting more exercise. All in all this idea was genius.\n\nAs you can see limiting car usage can help out the area big time that it is taking place. It is better breathing air, businesses like restaurants and parks would be used more and grow steadily, and the city would be taken care of better.\"\n81977e6c,0,\"Limiting car usage could have many advantages on our planet. Many cities, such as Vauban in Germany, have given up on using cars to help the world around them. \"\"vaughn's streets are completely carfree,except the main thoroughfare, where the tram to downtown Freiburg runs, and a few streets on one edge of the community.\"\" There is a movement going on called, \"\"smart planning\"\" and Vauban is just one example of a grow\n[Observation too long, truncated; Try other commands to get the left part.]",

The \"\"car free\"\" trend is beginning to spread throughout the world, and even to places in America. By limiting car usage, the state of the environment improves, a more healthy lifestyle is promoted, and opportunities for other innovations are brought into the light.\n\nIn Paris, a driving ban was enforced to help clear the air of pollutants. This ban lowered the congestion by 60 percent, and according to reporter Robert Duffer, \"\"The smog rivaled Bejing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world.\"\" Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gasses in Europe, and up to 50 percent in areas where cars are used more often, such as the United States. The Environmental protection Agency is promoting car reduced communities in America, where even legislators are beginning to act. By eliminating cars from the everyday equation, one also eliminates the greenhouse gasses and other pollutants, which makes the planet a healthier place to live.\n\nWith less and less cars being utilized, there are more opportunities for people to get active by biking, walking, and participating in other active means of getting from point A to point B. According to news reporters Andrew Selsky and Elisabeth Rosenthal, \"\"The swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering children drown out the occasional distant moter\"\", and \"\"Parks and sports centers have bloomed throughout the city uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks.\"\" Without cars, citizens are encouraged to get active. Condensed cities allow people to walk to their destination, which drastically improves an individual's heart health, along with aerobic activity such as biking.\n\nAn official from Transportation for America says, \"\"All of our development since World War II has been centered on the car, and that will have to change.\"\" Sociologists believe that America has passed peak driving, and cars are no longer the focus of improvement. The Internet makes telecommuting possible, which is much more convenient than using automobiles because people can feel connected without the drive. This and the rise in cellphones implies that while innovations used to be focused on transportation, telecommuting is the new big thing.\n\nWith many areas participating in the eventual elimination of automobiles, many are following suit. Sociologists believe that cars will eventually disappear.
