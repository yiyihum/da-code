  "system_message": "# CONTEXT #\nYou are a data scientist proficient in analyzing data. You excel at using Bash commands and Python code to solve data-related problems. You are working in a Bash environment with all necessary Python libraries installed. If you need to install additional libraries, you can use the 'pip install' command. You are starting in the /workspace directory, which contains all the data needed for your tasks. You can only use the actions provided in the ACTION SPACE to solve the task. The maximum number of steps you can take is 20.\n\n# ACTION SPACE #\n\n## Bash Action\n* Signature: Bash(code=\"shell_command\")\n* Description: This action string will execute a valid shell command in the `code` field. Only non-interactive commands are supported. Commands like \"vim\" and viewing images directly (e.g., using \"display\") are not allowed.\n* Example: Bash(code=\"ls -l\")\n\n## Python Action\n* Signature: Python(file_path=\"path/to/python_file\"):\n```python\nexecutable_python_code\n```\n* Description: This action will create a python file in the field `file_path` with the content wrapped by paired ``` symbols. If the file already exists, it will be overwritten. After creating the file, the python file will be executed. \n* Example: Python(file_path=\"./hello_world.py\"):\n```python\nprint(\"Hello, world!\")\n```\n\n## SQL Action\n* Signature: SQL(file_path=\"path/to/database_file\", command=\"sql_command\", output=\"path/to/output_file.csv\" or \"direct\")\n* Description: Executes an SQL command on the specified database file. If `output` is set to a file path, the results are saved to this CSV file; if set to 'direct', results are displayed directly.\n* Constraints:\n  - The database file must be accessible and in a format compatible with SQLite (e.g., .sqlite, .db).\n  - SQL commands must be valid and safely formatted to prevent security issues such as SQL injection.\n* Examples:\n  - Example1: SQL(file_path=\"data.sqlite\", command=\"SELECT name FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='table'\", output=\"directly\")\n  - Example2: SQL(file_path=\"data.db\", command=\"SELECT * FROM users\", output=\"users_output.csv\")\n\n## Terminate Action\n* Signature: Terminate(output=\"literal_answer_or_output_path\")\n* Description: This action denotes the completion of the entire task and returns the final answer or the output file/folder path. Make sure the output file is located in the initial workspace directory.\n* Examples:\n  - Example1: Terminate(output=\"New York\")\n  - Example2: Terminate(output=\"result.csv\")\n  - Example3: Terminate(output=\"FAIL\")\n\n\n# NOTICE #\n1. You need to fully understand the action space and its arguments before using it.\n2. You should first understand the environment and conduct data analysis on the given data before handling the task.\n3. You can't take some problems for granted. For example, you should check the existence of files before reading them.\n4. If the function execution fails, you should analyze the error and try to solve it.\n5. For challenging tasks like ML, you may need to verify the correctness of the method by checking the accuracy or other metrics, and try to optimize the method.\n6. Before finishing the task, ensure all instructions are met and verify the existence and correctness of any generated files.\n\n# RESPONSE FROMAT # \nFor each task input, your response should contain:\n1. One analysis of the task and the current environment, reasoning to determine the next action (prefix \"Thought: \").\n2. One action string in the ACTION SPACE (prefix \"Action: \").\n\n# EXAMPLE INTERACTION #\nObservation: ...(the output of last actions, as provided by the environment and the code output, you don't need to generate it)\n\nThought: ...\nAction: ...\n\n# TASK #\nThis is a dataset for a U.S. county-level monthly microbusiness data competition, with the description available in README.md.

You will develop an accurate model trained on U.S. county-level data.\n\nYour work will help policymakers gain visibility into microbusinesses, a growing trend of very small entities. Additional information will enable new policies and programs to improve the success and impact of these smallest of businesses.\n\n### Context\n\nAmerican policy leaders strive to develop economies that are more inclusive and resilient to downturns. They're also aware that with advances in technology, entrepreneurship has never been more accessible than it is today. Whether to create a more appropriate work/life balance, to follow a passion, or due to loss of employment, studies have demonstrated that Americans increasingly choose to create businesses of their own to meet their financial goals. The challenge is that these \"microbusinesses\" are often too small or too new to show up in traditional economic data sources, making it nearly impossible for policymakers to study them. But data science could help fill in the gaps and provide insights into the factors associated these businesses.\n\nOver the past few years the** **[Venture Forward](https://www.godaddy.com/ventureforward) team at GoDaddy has worked hard to produce data assets about the tens of millions of microbusinesses in the United States. Microbusinesses are generally defined as businesses with an online presence and ten or fewer employees. GoDaddy has visibility into more than 20 million of them, owned by more than 10 million entrepreneurs. We've surveyed this universe of microbusiness owners for several years and have collected a great deal of information on them that you can access via our** **[survey data here](https://www.godaddy.com/ventureforward/explore-the-data/?section=survey&cfips=6073).\n\nCurrent models leverage available internal and census data, use econometric approaches, and focus on understanding primary determinants. While these methods are adequate, there's potential to include additional data and using more advanced approaches to improve predictions and to better inform decision-making.\n\nCompetition host GoDaddy is the world\u2019s largest services platform for entrepreneurs around the globe. They're on a mission to empower their worldwide community of 20+ million customers\u2014and entrepreneurs everywhere\u2014by giving them all the help and tools they need to grow online.\n\nYour work will help better inform policymakers as they strive to make the world a better place for microbusiness entrepreneurs. This will have a real and substantial impact on communities across the country and will help our broader economy adapt to a constantly evolving world.\n\n### Evaluation\n\nlink\n\nkeyboard_arrow_up\n\nSubmissions are evaluated on** **[SMAPE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetric_mean_absolute_percentage_error) between forecasts and actual values.
