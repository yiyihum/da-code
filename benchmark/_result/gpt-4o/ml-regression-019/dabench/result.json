  "system_message": "# CONTEXT #\nYou are a data scientist proficient in analyzing data. You excel at using Bash commands and Python code to solve data-related problems. You are working in a Bash environment with all necessary Python libraries installed. If you need to install additional libraries, you can use the 'pip install' command. You are starting in the /workspace directory, which contains all the data needed for your tasks. You can only use the actions provided in the ACTION SPACE to solve the task. The maximum number of steps you can take is 20.\n\n# ACTION SPACE #\n\n## Bash Action\n* Signature: Bash(code=\"shell_command\")\n* Description: This action string will execute a valid shell command in the `code` field. Only non-interactive commands are supported. Commands like \"vim\" and viewing images directly (e.g., using \"display\") are not allowed.\n* Example: Bash(code=\"ls -l\")\n\n## Python Action\n* Signature: Python(file_path=\"path/to/python_file\"):\n```python\nexecutable_python_code\n```\n* Description: This action will create a python file in the field `file_path` with the content wrapped by paired ``` symbols. If the file already exists, it will be overwritten. After creating the file, the python file will be executed. \n* Example: Python(file_path=\"./hello_world.py\"):\n```python\nprint(\"Hello, world!\")\n```\n\n## SQL Action\n* Signature: SQL(file_path=\"path/to/database_file\", command=\"sql_command\", output=\"path/to/output_file.csv\" or \"direct\")\n* Description: Executes an SQL command on the specified database file. If `output` is set to a file path, the results are saved to this CSV file; if set to 'direct', results are displayed directly.\n* Constraints:\n  - The database file must be accessible and in a format compatible with SQLite (e.g., .sqlite, .db).\n  - SQL commands must be valid and safely formatted to prevent security issues such as SQL injection.\n* Examples:\n  - Example1: SQL(file_path=\"data.sqlite\", command=\"SELECT name FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='table'\", output=\"directly\")\n  - Example2: SQL(file_path=\"data.db\", command=\"SELECT * FROM users\", output=\"users_output.csv\")\n\n## Terminate Action\n* Signature: Terminate(output=\"literal_answer_or_output_path\")\n* Description: This action denotes the completion of the entire task and returns the final answer or the output file/folder path. Make sure the output file is located in the initial workspace directory.\n* Examples:\n  - Example1: Terminate(output=\"New York\")\n  - Example2: Terminate(output=\"result.csv\")\n  - Example3: Terminate(output=\"FAIL\")\n\n\n# NOTICE #\n1. You need to fully understand the action space and its arguments before using it.\n2. You should first understand the environment and conduct data analysis on the given data before handling the task.\n3. You can't take some problems for granted. For example, you should check the existence of files before reading them.\n4. If the function execution fails, you should analyze the error and try to solve it.\n5. For challenging tasks like ML, you may need to verify the correctness of the method by checking the accuracy or other metrics, and try to optimize the method.\n6. Before finishing the task, ensure all instructions are met and verify the existence and correctness of any generated files.\n\n# RESPONSE FROMAT # \nFor each task input, your response should contain:\n1. One analysis of the task and the current environment, reasoning to determine the next action (prefix \"Thought: \").\n2. One action string in the ACTION SPACE (prefix \"Action: \").\n\n# EXAMPLE INTERACTION #\nObservation: ...(the output of last actions, as provided by the environment and the code output, you don't need to generate it)\n\nThought: ...\nAction: ...\n\n# TASK #\nThis is an Electric Motor Temperature dataset, with relevant descriptions provided in the README.md file.

Moreover, 17 additional measurement profiles were added, expanding the dataset from 138 hours to 185 hours of records.\n\n## Context\n\nThe data set comprises several sensor data collected from a permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) deployed on a test bench. The PMSM represents a german OEM's prototype model. Test bench measurements were collected by the** **[LEA department](https://ei.uni-paderborn.de/en/lea/) at Paderborn University.** **\n\n## Content\n\nAll recordings are sampled at 2 Hz. The data set consists of multiple measurement sessions, which can be distinguished from each other by column \"profile_id\". A measurement session can be between one and six hours long.\n\nThe motor is excited by hand-designed driving cycles denoting a reference motor speed and a reference torque.\nCurrents in d/q-coordinates (columns \"i_d\" and i_q\") and voltages in d/q-coordinates (columns \"u_d\" and \"u_q\") are a result of a standard control strategy trying to follow the reference speed and torque.\nColumns \"motor_speed\" and \"torque\" are the resulting quantities achieved by that strategy, derived from set currents and voltages.\n\nMost driving cycles denote random walks in the speed-torque-plane in order to imitate real world driving cycles to a more accurate degree than constant excitations and ramp-ups and -downs would.\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nSeveral publications leveraged the setup of the PMSM in the Paderborn University Lab:\n\n### Temperature Estimation on the same motor but different data\n\n* [Determination of rotor temperature for an interior permanent magnet synchronous machine using a precise flux observer](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6869784)\n* [Investigation of Long Short-Term Memory Networks to Temperature Prediction for Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motors](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7966088)\n* [Real-Time Capable Methods to Determine the Magnet Temperature of Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motors \u2014 A Review](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7048594)\n* [Improved Fusion of Permanent Magnet Temperature Estimation Techniques for Synchronous Motors Using a Kalman Filter](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8672935)\n* [Fusion of a lumped-parameter thermal network and speed-dependent flux observer for PM temperature estimation in synchronous machines](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8333640)\n* [Fusion of direct and indirect temperature estimation techniques for permanent magnet synchronous motors](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8002038)\n* [Sensitivity analysis of a permanent magnet temperature observer for PM synchronous machines using the Monte Carlo method](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8289188)\n* [Observing the Permanent-Magnet Temperature of Synchro\n[Observation too long, truncated; Try other commands to get the left part.]",
