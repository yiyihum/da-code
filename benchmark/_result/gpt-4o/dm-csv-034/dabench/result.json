  "system_message": "# CONTEXT #\nYou are a data scientist proficient in analyzing data. You excel at using Bash commands and Python code to solve data-related problems. You are working in a Bash environment with all necessary Python libraries installed. If you need to install additional libraries, you can use the 'pip install' command. You are starting in the /workspace directory, which contains all the data needed for your tasks. You can only use the actions provided in the ACTION SPACE to solve the task. The maximum number of steps you can take is 20.\n\n# ACTION SPACE #\n\n## Bash Action\n* Signature: Bash(code=\"shell_command\")\n* Description: This action string will execute a valid shell command in the `code` field. Only non-interactive commands are supported. Commands like \"vim\" and viewing images directly (e.g., using \"display\") are not allowed.\n* Example: Bash(code=\"ls -l\")\n\n## Python Action\n* Signature: Python(file_path=\"path/to/python_file\"):\n```python\nexecutable_python_code\n```\n* Description: This action will create a python file in the field `file_path` with the content wrapped by paired ``` symbols. If the file already exists, it will be overwritten. After creating the file, the python file will be executed. \n* Example: Python(file_path=\"./hello_world.py\"):\n```python\nprint(\"Hello, world!\")\n```\n\n## SQL Action\n* Signature: SQL(file_path=\"path/to/database_file\", command=\"sql_command\", output=\"path/to/output_file.csv\" or \"direct\")\n* Description: Executes an SQL command on the specified database file. If `output` is set to a file path, the results are saved to this CSV file; if set to 'direct', results are displayed directly.\n* Constraints:\n  - The database file must be accessible and in a format compatible with SQLite (e.g., .sqlite, .db).\n  - SQL commands must be valid and safely formatted to prevent security issues such as SQL injection.\n* Examples:\n  - Example1: SQL(file_path=\"data.sqlite\", command=\"SELECT name FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='table'\", output=\"directly\")\n  - Example2: SQL(file_path=\"data.db\", command=\"SELECT * FROM users\", output=\"users_output.csv\")\n\n## Terminate Action\n* Signature: Terminate(output=\"literal_answer_or_output_path\")\n* Description: This action denotes the completion of the entire task and returns the final answer or the output file/folder path. Make sure the output file is located in the initial workspace directory.\n* Examples:\n  - Example1: Terminate(output=\"New York\")\n  - Example2: Terminate(output=\"result.csv\")\n  - Example3: Terminate(output=\"FAIL\")\n\n\n# NOTICE #\n1. You need to fully understand the action space and its arguments before using it.\n2. You should first understand the environment and conduct data analysis on the given data before handling the task.\n3. You can't take some problems for granted. For example, you should check the existence of files before reading them.\n4. If the function execution fails, you should analyze the error and try to solve it.\n5. For challenging tasks like ML, you may need to verify the correctness of the method by checking the accuracy or other metrics, and try to optimize the method.\n6. Before finishing the task, ensure all instructions are met and verify the existence and correctness of any generated files.\n\n# RESPONSE FROMAT # \nFor each task input, your response should contain:\n1. One analysis of the task and the current environment, reasoning to determine the next action (prefix \"Thought: \").\n2. One action string in the ACTION SPACE (prefix \"Action: \").\n\n# EXAMPLE INTERACTION #\nObservation: ...(the output of last actions, as provided by the environment and the code output, you don't need to generate it)\n\nThought: ...\nAction: ...\n\n# TASK #\nThis is a dataset titled \u201cMobile-Games-Testing-with-Cookie-Cats,\u201d with detailed descriptions provided in the README.md file.

      "observation": "# Mobile-Games-A-B-Testing-with-Cookie-Cats\n\nCookie Cats is a hugely popular mobile puzzle game developed by Tactile Entertainment. It's a classic \"connect three\" style puzzle game \nwhere the player must connect tiles of the same color in order to clear the board and win the level. It also features singing cats. Use\nURL below to view a trailer of the game:7\n\nhttps://youtu.be/GaP5f0jVTWE\n\nAs players progress through the game they will encounter gates that force them to wait some time before they can progress or make an \nin-app purchase. In this project, we will analyze the result of an AB-test where the first gate in Cookie Cats was moved from level 30 to \nlevel 40. In particular, we will analyze the impact on player retention.\n\n## 9. 7-day retention by AB-group\n<p>The bootstrap analysis tells us that there is a high probability that 1-day retention is better when the gate is at level 30. However, since players have only been playing the game for one day, it is likely that most players haven't reached level 30 yet. That is, many players won't have been affected by the gate, even if it's as early as level 30. </p>\n<p>But after having played for a week, more players should have reached level 40, and therefore it makes sense to also look at 7-day retention. That is: What percentage of the people that installed the game also showed up a week later to play the game again.</p>\n<p>Let's start by calculating 7-day retention for the two AB-groups.</p>",
