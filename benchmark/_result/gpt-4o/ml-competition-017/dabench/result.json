You are working in a Bash environment with all necessary Python libraries installed. If you need to install additional libraries, you can use the 'pip install' command. You are starting in the /workspace directory, which contains all the data needed for your tasks. You can only use the actions provided in the ACTION SPACE to solve the task. The maximum number of steps you can take is 20.\n\n# ACTION SPACE #\n\n## Bash Action\n* Signature: Bash(code=\"shell_command\")\n* Description: This action string will execute a valid shell command in the `code` field. Only non-interactive commands are supported. Commands like \"vim\" and viewing images directly (e.g., using \"display\") are not allowed.\n* Example: Bash(code=\"ls -l\")\n\n## Python Action\n* Signature: Python(file_path=\"path/to/python_file\"):\n```python\nexecutable_python_code\n```\n* Description: This action will create a python file in the field `file_path` with the content wrapped by paired ``` symbols. If the file already exists, it will be overwritten. After creating the file, the python file will be executed. \n* Example: Python(file_path=\"./hello_world.py\"):\n```python\nprint(\"Hello, world!\")\n```\n\n## SQL Action\n* Signature: SQL(file_path=\"path/to/database_file\", command=\"sql_command\", output=\"path/to/output_file.csv\" or \"direct\")\n* Description: Executes an SQL command on the specified database file. If `output` is set to a file path, the results are saved to this CSV file; if set to 'direct', results are displayed directly.\n* Constraints:\n  - The database file must be accessible and in a format compatible with SQLite (e.g., .sqlite, .db).\n  - SQL commands must be valid and safely formatted to prevent security issues such as SQL injection.\n* Examples:\n  - Example1: SQL(file_path=\"data.sqlite\", command=\"SELECT name FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='table'\", output=\"directly\")\n  - Example2: SQL(file_path=\"data.db\", command=\"SELECT * FROM users\", output=\"users_output.csv\")\n\n## Terminate Action\n* Signature: Terminate(output=\"literal_answer_or_output_path\")\n* Description: This action denotes the completion of the entire task and returns the final answer or the output file/folder path. Make sure the output file is located in the initial workspace directory.\n* Examples:\n  - Example1: Terminate(output=\"New York\")\n  - Example2: Terminate(output=\"result.csv\")\n  - Example3: Terminate(output=\"FAIL\")\n\n\n# NOTICE #\n1.

It is also time-consuming for educators to grade by hand. Automated Writing Evaluation (AWE) systems can score essays to supplement an educator\u2019s other efforts. AWEs also allow students to receive regular and timely feedback on their writing. However, due to their costs, many advancements in the field are not widely available to students and educators. Open-source solutions to assess student writing are needed to reach every community with these important educational tools.\nPrevious efforts to develop open-source AWEs have been limited by small datasets that were not nationally diverse or focused on common essay formats. The first Automated Essay Scoring competition scored student-written short-answer responses, however, this is a writing task not often used in the classroom. To improve upon earlier efforts, a more expansive dataset that includes high-quality, realistic classroom writing samples was required. Further, to broaden the impact, the dataset should include samples across economic and location populations to mitigate the potential of algorithmic bias.\nIn this competition, you will work with the largest open-access writing dataset aligned to current standards for student-appropriate assessments.

On average,an American spends about thirty-five to fourty dollars on gas per fill-up and one hundred to two hundred dollars a month on insurance a month depending on age,experience,accidents,etc. By limiting your car usage comletely or even just a little just imagine the extra money you'll have aying around for the nessecities and maybe even a ittle you-time. Say you buy a bike and the only time you use your car is to drive to work and anywhere out-of-state,that means that you'll be able to go a week with roughly two gallons of gas. That puts you at about thirty-eight hundred dollars a year where if you were purchasing four or five gallons a week you'd be spending approximately eleven thousand dollars a year. Thats no chump change. You're insurance would gradually decrease due to safe driving and age so along with gas being cheaper,so would the insurance.\n\nFlorida is a state well-known for car crashes due to weather conditions like rain and fog and you can't do anything to change that other than take a different,much safer mode of transportaion such as a bus. Nowadays bus and semi-truck drivers are more experienced and cautius then they used to for one reason,CYB(Cover your Butt).You see major bus and semi-truck companies now that due to the size of their vehicles,if there's ever crash involving one of their autmobiles then they're likely to get blamed cause of the size of the vehicles and so it would make since for them to send their drivers to extensive training and make sure that their trucks are in good hands,which is exactly what they do. Studies show that you're chances of being in a wreck in a bus are one of every one hundred rides while being in a car driven by yourself puts you at a whopping one of ten ridesyur chances of safety are greatly increased.\n\nThe United States of America has no shortage of pollution and that's not helped by the fact that we have one of the largest populations of personal automobiles inhabiting this country.

In the US up to fifty percent of greenhouse gas is from cars(certain areas).If you stop using you car and ride a bike even thugh it won't seem like muchyou'd be suprised at the difference.
