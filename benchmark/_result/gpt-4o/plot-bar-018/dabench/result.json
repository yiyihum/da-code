You need to calculate the average days to issue for each day of the week and plot the results in a bar chart, saving it as 'result.png'. The chart should have a size of (12, 6), with the title 'Average Days to Issue by Weekday', the x-axis titled 'Weekday', and the y-axis titled 'Average Days to Issue'. The color of the bars should be 'skyblue'.",
  "system_message": "# CONTEXT #\nYou are a data scientist proficient in analyzing data. You excel at using Bash commands and Python code to solve data-related problems. You are working in a Bash environment with all necessary Python libraries installed. If you need to install additional libraries, you can use the 'pip install' command. You are starting in the /workspace directory, which contains all the data needed for your tasks. You can only use the actions provided in the ACTION SPACE to solve the task. The maximum number of steps you can take is 20.\n\n# ACTION SPACE #\n\n## Bash Action\n* Signature: Bash(code=\"shell_command\")\n* Description: This action string will execute a valid shell command in the `code` field. Only non-interactive commands are supported. Commands like \"vim\" and viewing images directly (e.g., using \"display\") are not allowed.\n* Example: Bash(code=\"ls -l\")\n\n## Python Action\n* Signature: Python(file_path=\"path/to/python_file\"):\n```python\nexecutable_python_code\n```\n* Description: This action will create a python file in the field `file_path` with the content wrapped by paired ``` symbols. If the file already exists, it will be overwritten. After creating the file, the python file will be executed. \n* Example: Python(file_path=\"./hello_world.py\"):\n```python\nprint(\"Hello, world!\")\n```\n\n## SQL Action\n* Signature: SQL(file_path=\"path/to/database_file\", command=\"sql_command\", output=\"path/to/output_file.csv\" or \"direct\")\n* Description: Executes an SQL command on the specified database file. If `output` is set to a file path, the results are saved to this CSV file; if set to 'direct', results are displayed directly.\n* Constraints:\n  - The database file must be accessible and in a format compatible with SQLite (e.g., .sqlite, .db).\n  - SQL commands must be valid and safely formatted to prevent security issues such as SQL injection.\n* Examples:\n  - Example1: SQL(file_path=\"data.sqlite\", command=\"SELECT name FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='table'\", output=\"directly\")\n  - Example2: SQL(file_path=\"data.db\", command=\"SELECT * FROM users\", output=\"users_output.csv\")\n\n## Terminate Action\n* Signature: Terminate(output=\"literal_answer_or_output_path\")\n* Description: This action denotes the completion of the entire task and returns the final answer or the output file/folder path. Make sure the output file is located in the initial workspace directory.\n* Examples:\n  - Example1: Terminate(output=\"New York\")\n  - Example2: Terminate(output=\"result.csv\")\n  - Example3: Terminate(output=\"FAIL\")\n\n\n# NOTICE #\n1. You need to fully understand the action space and its arguments before using it.\n2. You should first understand the environment and conduct data analysis on the given data before handling the task.\n3. You can't take some problems for granted. For example, you should check the existence of files before reading them.\n4. If the function execution fails, you should analyze the error and try to solve it.\n5. For challenging tasks like ML, you may need to verify the correctness of the method by checking the accuracy or other metrics, and try to optimize the method.\n6. Before finishing the task, ensure all instructions are met and verify the existence and correctness of any generated files.\n\n# RESPONSE FROMAT # \nFor each task input, your response should contain:\n1. One analysis of the task and the current environment, reasoning to determine the next action (prefix \"Thought: \").\n2. One action string in the ACTION SPACE (prefix \"Action: \").\n\n# EXAMPLE INTERACTION #\nObservation: ...(the output of last actions, as provided by the environment and the code output, you don't need to generate it)\n\nThought: ...\nAction: ...\n\n# TASK #\nThis is a Kickstarter Projects dataset, with relevant descriptions in the README.md file.

Right now I just collect data and the only app i've made is this twitter bot which tweet any project reaching some milestone:** **[@bloomwatcher](https://www.kaggle.com/bloomwatcher) . I have a lot of other ideas, but sadly not enough time to develop them\u2026 But I hope you can!\n\n### Content\n\nYou'll find most useful data for project analysis. Columns are self explanatory except:\n\n* usd_pledged: conversion in US dollars of the pledged column (conversion done by kickstarter).\n* usd pledge real: conversion in US dollars of the pledged column (conversion from** **[Fixer.io API](http://fixer.io/)).\n* usd goal real: conversion in US dollars of the goal column (conversion from** **[Fixer.io API](http://fixer.io/)).\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nData are collected from** **[Kickstarter Platform](https://www.kickstarter.com/)\n\nusd conversion (usd_pledged_real and usd_goal_real columns) were generated from** **[convert ks pledges to usd](https://www.kaggle.com/tonyplaysguitar/convert-ks-pledges-to-usd/) script done by** **[tonyplaysguitar](https://www.kaggle.com/tonyplaysguitar)\n\n### Inspiration\n\nI hope to see great projects, and why not a model to predict if a project will be successful before it is released? :)",
