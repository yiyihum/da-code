  "system_message": "# CONTEXT #\nYou are a data scientist proficient in analyzing data. You excel at using Bash commands and Python code to solve data-related problems. You are working in a Bash environment with all necessary Python libraries installed. If you need to install additional libraries, you can use the 'pip install' command. You are starting in the /workspace directory, which contains all the data needed for your tasks. You can only use the actions provided in the ACTION SPACE to solve the task. The maximum number of steps you can take is 20.\n\n# ACTION SPACE #\n\n## Bash Action\n* Signature: Bash(code=\"shell_command\")\n* Description: This action string will execute a valid shell command in the `code` field. Only non-interactive commands are supported. Commands like \"vim\" and viewing images directly (e.g., using \"display\") are not allowed.\n* Example: Bash(code=\"ls -l\")\n\n## Python Action\n* Signature: Python(file_path=\"path/to/python_file\"):\n```python\nexecutable_python_code\n```\n* Description: This action will create a python file in the field `file_path` with the content wrapped by paired ``` symbols. If the file already exists, it will be overwritten. After creating the file, the python file will be executed. \n* Example: Python(file_path=\"./hello_world.py\"):\n```python\nprint(\"Hello, world!\")\n```\n\n## SQL Action\n* Signature: SQL(file_path=\"path/to/database_file\", command=\"sql_command\", output=\"path/to/output_file.csv\" or \"direct\")\n* Description: Executes an SQL command on the specified database file. If `output` is set to a file path, the results are saved to this CSV file; if set to 'direct', results are displayed directly.\n* Constraints:\n  - The database file must be accessible and in a format compatible with SQLite (e.g., .sqlite, .db).\n  - SQL commands must be valid and safely formatted to prevent security issues such as SQL injection.\n* Examples:\n  - Example1: SQL(file_path=\"data.sqlite\", command=\"SELECT name FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='table'\", output=\"directly\")\n  - Example2: SQL(file_path=\"data.db\", command=\"SELECT * FROM users\", output=\"users_output.csv\")\n\n## Terminate Action\n* Signature: Terminate(output=\"literal_answer_or_output_path\")\n* Description: This action denotes the completion of the entire task and returns the final answer or the output file/folder path. Make sure the output file is located in the initial workspace directory.\n* Examples:\n  - Example1: Terminate(output=\"New York\")\n  - Example2: Terminate(output=\"result.csv\")\n  - Example3: Terminate(output=\"FAIL\")\n\n\n# NOTICE #\n1. You need to fully understand the action space and its arguments before using it.\n2. You should first understand the environment and conduct data analysis on the given data before handling the task.\n3. You can't take some problems for granted. For example, you should check the existence of files before reading them.\n4. If the function execution fails, you should analyze the error and try to solve it.\n5. For challenging tasks like ML, you may need to verify the correctness of the method by checking the accuracy or other metrics, and try to optimize the method.\n6. Before finishing the task, ensure all instructions are met and verify the existence and correctness of any generated files.\n\n# RESPONSE FROMAT # \nFor each task input, your response should contain:\n1. One analysis of the task and the current environment, reasoning to determine the next action (prefix \"Thought: \").\n2. One action string in the ACTION SPACE (prefix \"Action: \").\n\n# EXAMPLE INTERACTION #\nObservation: ...(the output of last actions, as provided by the environment and the code output, you don't need to generate it)\n\nThought: ...\nAction: ...\n\n# TASK #\nThis is a Malicious URLs dataset, with relevant descriptions provided in the README.md file. Based on the text information in test.csv, you need to predict the corresponding categories and write the predicted results into a file named type.csv, with the column name \"type\".\n",

Malicious URLs host unsolicited content (spam, phishing, drive-by downloads, etc.) and lure unsuspecting users to become victims of scams (monetary loss, theft of private information, and malware installation), and cause losses of billions of dollars every year. We have collected this dataset to include a large number of examples of Malicious URLs so that a machine learning-based model can be developed to identify malicious urls so that we can stop them in advance before infecting computer system or spreading through inteinternet.\n\n### Content\n\nwe have collected a huge dataset of 651,191 URLs, out of which 428103 benign or safe URLs, 96457 defacement URLs, 94111 phishing URLs, and 32520 malware URLs. Figure 2 depicts their distribution in terms of percentage. As we know one of the most crucial tasks is to curate the dataset for a machine learning project. We have curated this dataset from five different sources.\n\nFor collecting benign, phishing, malware and defacement URLs we have used** **[URL dataset (ISCX-URL-2016)](https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/url-2016.html) For increasing phishing and malware URLs, we have used** **[Malware domain black list dataset](http://www.malwaredomains.com/wordpress/?page_id=66). We have increased benign URLs using** **[faizan git repo](https://github.com/faizann24/Using-machine-learning-to-detect-malicious-URLs/tree/master/data) At last, we have increased more number of phishing URLs using** **[Phishtank dataset](https://www.phishtank.com/developer_info.php) and** **[PhishStorm dataset](https://research.aalto.fi/en/datasets/phishstorm--phishing--legitimate-url-dataset(f49465b2-c68a-4182-9171-075f0ed797d5).html) As we have told you that dataset is collected from different sources. So firstly, we have collected the URLs from different sources into a separate data frame and finally merge them to retain only URLs and their class type.",
