You are working in a Bash environment with all necessary Python libraries installed. If you need to install additional libraries, you can use the 'pip install' command. You are starting in the /workspace directory, which contains all the data needed for your tasks. You can only use the actions provided in the ACTION SPACE to solve the task. The maximum number of steps you can take is 20.\n\n# ACTION SPACE #\n\n## Bash Action\n* Signature: Bash(code=\"shell_command\")\n* Description: This action string will execute a valid shell command in the `code` field. Only non-interactive commands are supported. Commands like \"vim\" and viewing images directly (e.g., using \"display\") are not allowed.\n* Example: Bash(code=\"ls -l\")\n\n## Python Action\n* Signature: Python(file_path=\"path/to/python_file\"):\n```python\nexecutable_python_code\n```\n* Description: This action will create a python file in the field `file_path` with the content wrapped by paired ``` symbols. If the file already exists, it will be overwritten. After creating the file, the python file will be executed. \n* Example: Python(file_path=\"./hello_world.py\"):\n```python\nprint(\"Hello, world!\")\n```\n\n## SQL Action\n* Signature: SQL(file_path=\"path/to/database_file\", command=\"sql_command\", output=\"path/to/output_file.csv\" or \"direct\")\n* Description: Executes an SQL command on the specified database file. If `output` is set to a file path, the results are saved to this CSV file; if set to 'direct', results are displayed directly.\n* Constraints:\n  - The database file must be accessible and in a format compatible with SQLite (e.g., .sqlite, .db).\n  - SQL commands must be valid and safely formatted to prevent security issues such as SQL injection.\n* Examples:\n  - Example1: SQL(file_path=\"data.sqlite\", command=\"SELECT name FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='table'\", output=\"directly\")\n  - Example2: SQL(file_path=\"data.db\", command=\"SELECT * FROM users\", output=\"users_output.csv\")\n\n## Terminate Action\n* Signature: Terminate(output=\"literal_answer_or_output_path\")\n* Description: This action denotes the completion of the entire task and returns the final answer or the output file/folder path. Make sure the output file is located in the initial workspace directory.\n* Examples:\n  - Example1: Terminate(output=\"New York\")\n  - Example2: Terminate(output=\"result.csv\")\n  - Example3: Terminate(output=\"FAIL\")\n\n\n# NOTICE #\n1. You need to fully understand the action space and its arguments before using it.\n2. You should first understand the environment and conduct data analysis on the given data before handling the task.\n3. You can't take some problems for granted. For example, you should check the existence of files before reading them.\n4. If the function execution fails, you should analyze the error and try to solve it.\n5. For challenging tasks like ML, you may need to verify the correctness of the method by checking the accuracy or other metrics, and try to optimize the method.\n6. Before finishing the task, ensure all instructions are met and verify the existence and correctness of any generated files.\n\n# RESPONSE FROMAT # \nFor each task input, your response should contain:\n1.

      "observation": "## Overview\n\nIn recent years, large language models (LLMs) have become increasingly sophisticated, capable of generating text that is difficult to distinguish from human-written text. In this competition, we hope to foster open research and transparency on AI detection techniques applicable in the real world.\n\nThis competition challenges participants to develop a machine learning model that can accurately detect whether an essay was written by a student or an LLM. The competition dataset comprises a mix of student-written essays and essays generated by a variety of LLMs.\n\nStart\n\nNov 1, 2023\n\n###### Close\n\nJan 23, 2024\n\nMerger & Entry\n\n### Description\n\nlink\n\nkeyboard_arrow_up\n\nCan you help build a model to identify which essay was written by middle and high school students, and which was written using a large language model? With the spread of LLMs, many people fear they will replace or alter work that would usually be done by humans. Educators are especially concerned about their impact on students\u2019 skill development, though many remain optimistic that LLMs will ultimately be a useful tool to help students improve their writing skills.\n\nAt the forefront of academic concerns about LLMs is their potential to enable plagiarism. LLMs are trained on a massive dataset of text and code, which means that they are able to generate text that is very similar to human-written text. For example, students could use LLMs to generate essays that are not their own, missing crucial learning keystones. Your work on this competition can help identify telltale LLM artifacts and advance the state of the art in LLM text detection. By using texts of moderate length on a variety of subjects and multiple, unknown generative models, we aim to replicate typical detection scenarios and incentivize learning features that generalize across models.\n\nVanderbilt University, together with The Learning Agency Lab, an independent nonprofit based in Arizona, have collaborated with Kaggle on this competition** **\n\n### Acknowledgments\n\nVanderbilt University and the Learning Agency Lab would like to thank the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Schmidt Futures, and Chan Zuckerberg Initiative for their support in making this work possible.** **\n\n[![](https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-media/competitions/The%20Learning%20Agency/BMGF_logo_black_300dpi%20(1).jpg)         ](https://www.gatesfoundation.org/)[![](https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-media/competitions/The%20Learning%20Agency/Schmidt%20Futures%20Logo.png)        ](https://schmidtfutures.com/)[![](https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-media/competitions/The%20Learning%20Agency/1200px-Chan_Zuckerberg_Initiative.svg.png)         ](https://chanzuckerberg.com/)\n\n### Evaluation\n\nlink\n\nkeyboard_arrow_up\n\nSubmissions are evaluated on** **[area under the ROC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_operating_characteristic) curve between the predicted probability and the observed target.\n\n## Submission File\n\nFor each** **`id` in the test\n[Observation too long, truncated; Try other commands to get the left part.]",
