  "system_message": "# CONTEXT #\nYou are a data scientist proficient in analyzing data. You excel at using Bash commands and Python code to solve data-related problems. You are working in a Bash environment with all necessary Python libraries installed. If you need to install additional libraries, you can use the 'pip install' command. You are starting in the /workspace directory, which contains all the data needed for your tasks. You can only use the actions provided in the ACTION SPACE to solve the task. The maximum number of steps you can take is 20.\n\n# ACTION SPACE #\n\n## Bash Action\n* Signature: Bash(code=\"shell_command\")\n* Description: This action string will execute a valid shell command in the `code` field. Only non-interactive commands are supported. Commands like \"vim\" and viewing images directly (e.g., using \"display\") are not allowed.\n* Example: Bash(code=\"ls -l\")\n\n## Python Action\n* Signature: Python(file_path=\"path/to/python_file\"):\n```python\nexecutable_python_code\n```\n* Description: This action will create a python file in the field `file_path` with the content wrapped by paired ``` symbols. If the file already exists, it will be overwritten. After creating the file, the python file will be executed. \n* Example: Python(file_path=\"./hello_world.py\"):\n```python\nprint(\"Hello, world!\")\n```\n\n## SQL Action\n* Signature: SQL(file_path=\"path/to/database_file\", command=\"sql_command\", output=\"path/to/output_file.csv\" or \"direct\")\n* Description: Executes an SQL command on the specified database file. If `output` is set to a file path, the results are saved to this CSV file; if set to 'direct', results are displayed directly.\n* Constraints:\n  - The database file must be accessible and in a format compatible with SQLite (e.g., .sqlite, .db).\n  - SQL commands must be valid and safely formatted to prevent security issues such as SQL injection.\n* Examples:\n  - Example1: SQL(file_path=\"data.sqlite\", command=\"SELECT name FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='table'\", output=\"directly\")\n  - Example2: SQL(file_path=\"data.db\", command=\"SELECT * FROM users\", output=\"users_output.csv\")\n\n## Terminate Action\n* Signature: Terminate(output=\"literal_answer_or_output_path\")\n* Description: This action denotes the completion of the entire task and returns the final answer or the output file/folder path. Make sure the output file is located in the initial workspace directory.\n* Examples:\n  - Example1: Terminate(output=\"New York\")\n  - Example2: Terminate(output=\"result.csv\")\n  - Example3: Terminate(output=\"FAIL\")\n\n\n# NOTICE #\n1. You need to fully understand the action space and its arguments before using it.\n2. You should first understand the environment and conduct data analysis on the given data before handling the task.\n3. You can't take some problems for granted. For example, you should check the existence of files before reading them.\n4. If the function execution fails, you should analyze the error and try to solve it.\n5. For challenging tasks like ML, you may need to verify the correctness of the method by checking the accuracy or other metrics, and try to optimize the method.\n6. Before finishing the task, ensure all instructions are met and verify the existence and correctness of any generated files.\n\n# RESPONSE FROMAT # \nFor each task input, your response should contain:\n1. One analysis of the task and the current environment, reasoning to determine the next action (prefix \"Thought: \").\n2. One action string in the ACTION SPACE (prefix \"Action: \").\n\n# EXAMPLE INTERACTION #\nObservation: ...(the output of last actions, as provided by the environment and the code output, you don't need to generate it)\n\nThought: ...\nAction: ...\n\n# TASK #\nThis is the 2018 Kaggle Machine Learning & Data Science Survey dataset, with relevant descriptions in the README.md file. Your task is to draw a bar chart showing the number of people in each age group who filled out the survey. The method for dividing age groups is outlined in AgeGroup.md.

      "observation": "## bout Dataset\n\n# Overview\n\nWelcome to Kaggle's second annual Machine Learning and Data Science Survey \u2015 and our first-ever survey data challenge.\n\nThis year,** **[as last year](https://www.kaggle.com/kaggle/kaggle-survey-2017), we set out to conduct an industry-wide survey that presents a truly comprehensive view of the state of data science and machine learning. The survey was live for one week in October, and after cleaning the data we finished with 23,859 responses, a 49% increase over last year!\n\nThere's a lot to explore here. The results include raw numbers about who is working with data, what\u2019s happening with machine learning in different industries, and the best ways for new data scientists to break into the field. We've published the data in as raw a format as possible without compromising anonymization, which makes it an unusual example of a survey dataset.\n\n---\n\n# Challenge\n\nThis year Kaggle is launching the first Data Science Survey Challenge, where we will be awarding a prize pool of $28,000 to kernel authors who tell a rich story about a subset of the data science and machine learning community..** **\n\nIn our second year running this survey, we were once again awed by the global, diverse, and dynamic nature of the data science and machine learning industry. This** **[survey data EDA](https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/2018-kaggle-ml-and-ds-survey-eda) provides an overview of the industry on an aggregate scale, but it also leaves us wanting to know more about the many specific communities comprised within the survey. For that reason, we\u2019re inviting the Kaggle community to dive deep into the survey datasets and help us tell the diverse stories of data scientists from around the world.** **\n\n**The challenge objective:** tell a data story about a subset of the data science community represented in this survey, through a combination of both narrative text and data exploration. A \u201cstory\u201d could be defined any number of ways, and that\u2019s deliberate. The challenge is to deeply explore (through data) the impact, priorities, or concerns of a specific group of data science and machine learning practitioners. That group can be defined in the macro (for example: anyone who does most of their coding in Python) or the micro (for example: female data science students studying machine learning in masters programs). This is an opportunity to be creative and tell the story of a community you identify with or are passionate about!** **\n\nSubmissions will be evaluated on the following:** **\n\n* Composition - Is there a clear narrative thread to the story that\u2019s articulated and supported by data? The subject should be well defined, well researched, and well supported through the use of data and visualizations.** **\n* Originality - Does the reader learn something new through this submission? Or is the reader challenged to think about something in a new way? A great entry will be informative, thought provoking, and fresh all at the same time.** **\n* Doc\n[Observation too long, truncated; Try other commands to get the left part.]",
