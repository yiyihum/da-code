  "system_message": "# CONTEXT #\nYou are a data scientist proficient in analyzing data. You excel at using Bash commands and Python code to solve data-related problems. You are working in a Bash environment with all necessary Python libraries installed. If you need to install additional libraries, you can use the 'pip install' command. You are starting in the /workspace directory, which contains all the data needed for your tasks. You can only use the actions provided in the ACTION SPACE to solve the task. The maximum number of steps you can take is 20.\n\n# ACTION SPACE #\n\n## Bash Action\n* Signature: Bash(code=\"shell_command\")\n* Description: This action string will execute a valid shell command in the `code` field. Only non-interactive commands are supported. Commands like \"vim\" and viewing images directly (e.g., using \"display\") are not allowed.\n* Example: Bash(code=\"ls -l\")\n\n## Python Action\n* Signature: Python(file_path=\"path/to/python_file\"):\n```python\nexecutable_python_code\n```\n* Description: This action will create a python file in the field `file_path` with the content wrapped by paired ``` symbols. If the file already exists, it will be overwritten. After creating the file, the python file will be executed. \n* Example: Python(file_path=\"./hello_world.py\"):\n```python\nprint(\"Hello, world!\")\n```\n\n## SQL Action\n* Signature: SQL(file_path=\"path/to/database_file\", command=\"sql_command\", output=\"path/to/output_file.csv\" or \"direct\")\n* Description: Executes an SQL command on the specified database file. If `output` is set to a file path, the results are saved to this CSV file; if set to 'direct', results are displayed directly.\n* Constraints:\n  - The database file must be accessible and in a format compatible with SQLite (e.g., .sqlite, .db).\n  - SQL commands must be valid and safely formatted to prevent security issues such as SQL injection.\n* Examples:\n  - Example1: SQL(file_path=\"data.sqlite\", command=\"SELECT name FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='table'\", output=\"directly\")\n  - Example2: SQL(file_path=\"data.db\", command=\"SELECT * FROM users\", output=\"users_output.csv\")\n\n## Terminate Action\n* Signature: Terminate(output=\"literal_answer_or_output_path\")\n* Description: This action denotes the completion of the entire task and returns the final answer or the output file/folder path. Make sure the output file is located in the initial workspace directory.\n* Examples:\n  - Example1: Terminate(output=\"New York\")\n  - Example2: Terminate(output=\"result.csv\")\n  - Example3: Terminate(output=\"FAIL\")\n\n\n# NOTICE #\n1. You need to fully understand the action space and its arguments before using it.\n2. You should first understand the environment and conduct data analysis on the given data before handling the task.\n3. You can't take some problems for granted. For example, you should check the existence of files before reading them.\n4. If the function execution fails, you should analyze the error and try to solve it.\n5. For challenging tasks like ML, you may need to verify the correctness of the method by checking the accuracy or other metrics, and try to optimize the method.\n6. Before finishing the task, ensure all instructions are met and verify the existence and correctness of any generated files.\n\n# RESPONSE FROMAT # \nFor each task input, your response should contain:\n1. One analysis of the task and the current environment, reasoning to determine the next action (prefix \"Thought: \").\n2. One action string in the ACTION SPACE (prefix \"Action: \").\n\n# EXAMPLE INTERACTION #\nObservation: ...(the output of last actions, as provided by the environment and the code output, you don't need to generate it)\n\nThought: ...\nAction: ...\n\n# TASK #\nYou have an AI Mathematical Olympiad - Progress Prize 1 dataset, with relevant descriptions provided in the README.md file. You need to retrieve the problem with ID \"739bc9\" in input_without_answer.csv and devise a method to answer the question corresponding to this ID.

If, for instance, you believe the answer to a problem is** **`2034`, your prediction should be** **`34`.\nYou should expect the difficulty of the problems to be a bit easier than AIME and targeted between AIME and** **[AMC&#39;12](https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/AMC_12_Problems_and_Solutions) level.\nAll problems are text-only with mathematical notation in LaTeX. Please see the** **`AIMO Prize - Note on Language and Notation.pdf` handout for details on the notational conventions used. Although some problems may involve geometry, diagrams are not used in any problem.\nThe public test set comprises exactly 50 problems, and the private test set comprises a distinct set of 50 problems. We also provide a selection of 10 problems for use as training data. The problems in the two test sets have been selected to balance both difficulty and subject area.\nPlease note that this is a** **[Code Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/ai-mathematical-olympiad-prize/overview/code-requirements). We give a few placeholder problems in the publicly visible** **`test.csv` file to help you author your submissions. These problems are not meant to be representative of the problems in the actual test set. When your submission is scored, this placeholder test data will be replaced with the actual test data.\nBecause of the limited number of problems available, we are taking special precautions to secure the test set against probing. Among other things, during the submission period the test set will comprise only the 50 public set problems. Once the competition ends, when we rerun submissions, the test set will comprise only the 50 private set problems.** ** **You should attempt to make sure your submission will complete successfully on the 50 new private set problems.** This may mean ensuring your submission is robust to unexpected inputs, or managing runtime and memory usage.\n\n## Fields\n\n* `id` - A unique identifier for each problem.\n* `problem` - A statement of the problem to be solved.",
