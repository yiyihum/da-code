CONTENT: The data contains several columns, but for the purpose of sentiment analysis, we are mainly interested in the 'OriginalTweet' and 'Sentiment' columns. The 'OriginalTweet' column contains the text of the tweets, and the 'Sentiment' column contains the sentiment of the tweets.

However, the 'Sentiment' column in the test data should be empty as we are supposed to predict these values. It seems there might be a misunderstanding in the task description. Normally, we would have a separate training dataset with known sentiments to train a model, and then use that model to predict the sentiments of the test data.

Since we don't have a training dataset here, we can't train a model. But we can still perform some basic text analysis on the 'OriginalTweet' column. For example, we can count the number of positive, negative, and neutral words in each tweet and classify the tweet based on which count is highest.

Let's first check if there are any missing values in the 'OriginalTweet' column.

Now, let's proceed with a simple sentiment analysis approach. We'll define lists of words that are commonly associated with positive, negative, and neutral sentiments. Then, we'll count the number of these words in each tweet and classify the tweet based on which count is highest.

Please note that this is a very basic approach and may not give accurate results. In a real-world scenario, we would use a more sophisticated approach like training a machine learning model on a labeled dataset.

CONTENT: It seems that our simple sentiment analysis approach is classifying most of the tweets as 'Neutral'. This is likely because our lists of sentiment words are very basic and don't cover all the words that could convey a positive or negative sentiment.

In a real-world scenario, we would use a more sophisticated approach like training a machine learning model on a labeled dataset. We could also use a pre-trained sentiment analysis model from a library like NLTK or TextBlob.

However, since we don't have a training dataset or the ability to install additional libraries in this environment, we'll proceed with our simple approach and write the predicted sentiments to a CSV file.
