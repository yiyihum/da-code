Dataset Description
The dataset for this competition (both train and test) was generated from a deep learning model trained on the Abalone dataset. Feature distributions are close to, but not exactly the same, as the original. Feel free to use the original dataset as part of this competition, both to explore differences as well as to see whether incorporating the original in training improves model performance.

Files

abalone.data: the original training dataset

train.csv - the training dataset; Rings is the integer target
test.csv - the test dataset; your objective is to predict the value of Rings for each row
sample_submission.csv - a sample submission file in the correct format

## About Dataset

### Abalone Dataset Description

**Sex:** Represents the gender of the abalone, categorized as male (M), female (F), or infant (I).

**Length:** Denotes the longest measurement of the abalone shell, from the apex to the base, measured in millimeters.

**Diameter:** Represents the measurement of the abalone shell perpendicular to its length, also measured in millimeters.

**Height:** Signifies the height of the abalone shell, measured perpendicular to the plane formed by the length and diameter, in millimeters.

**Whole Weight:** Indicates the total weight of the abalone, encompassing both the meat and the shell, measured in grams.

**Shucked Weight:** Represents the weight of the abalone meat only, measured in grams. It indicates the amount of meat extracted from the shell.

**Viscera Weight:** Signifies the weight of the abalone gut after bleeding, measured in grams. It provides insights into the weight of the internal organs of the abalone.

**Shell Weight:** Represents the weight of the abalone shell only, excluding the meat, measured in grams. It provides insights into the weight distribution between the shell and the edible portion of the abalone.

**Rings:** Signifies the number of rings present on the abalone shell, serving as an indicator of the abalone's age

THOUGHT: The README.md file provides a detailed description of the dataset. The dataset contains features such as Sex, Length, Diameter, Height, Whole Weight, Shucked Weight, Viscera Weight, Shell Weight, and the target variable is Rings, which signifies the number of rings present on the abalone shell, serving as an indicator of the abalone's age.
