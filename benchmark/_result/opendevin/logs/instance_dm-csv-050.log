CONTENT: The DataFrame contains the daily returns for the 9 biggest companies in 2017. 

Now, let's calculate the cumulative returns of the three different portfolio strategies: the default portfolio, the equal-weight portfolio, and the market value-weighted portfolio. 

The weights for the default portfolio and the market capitalizations for the market value-weighted portfolio are provided in the README.md file. 

Let's start by defining the weights for the three portfolios. 

For the default portfolio, the weights are as follows:

- Apple (AAPL): 12%
- Microsoft (MSFT): 15%
- Exxon Mobil (XOM): 8%
- Johnson & Johnson (JNJ): 5%
- JP Morgan (JPM): 9%
- Amazon (AMZN): 10%
- General Electric (GE): 11%
- Facebook (FB): 14%
- AT&T (T): 16%

For the equal-weight portfolio, each company has a weight of 1/9 or approximately 11.11%.

For the market value-weighted portfolio, the weights are proportional to the market capitalizations of the companies. The market capitalizations are as follows:

- Apple (AAPL): 601.51 billion USD
- Microsoft (MSFT): 469.25 billion USD
- Exxon Mobil (XOM): 349.5 billion USD
- Johnson & Johnson (JNJ): 310.48 billion USD
- JP Morgan (JPM): 299.77 billion USD
- Amazon (AMZN): 356.94 billion USD
- General Electric (GE): 268.88 billion USD
- Facebook (FB): 331.57 billion USD
- AT&T (T): 246.09 billion USD

Let's calculate the weights for the market value-weighted portfolio. The weight for each company is its market capitalization divided by the total market capitalization of all companies. 

Let's define these weights in the code.
