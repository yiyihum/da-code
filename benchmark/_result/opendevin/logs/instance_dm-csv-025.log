This piece of code updates the team names in the 'match_data' DataFrame. It replaces occurrences of 'Rising Pune Supergiant' with 'Rising Pune Supergiants' in the columns 'team1', 'team2', 'winner', and 'toss_winner'.

Specifically, it utilizes the Pandas 'apply' function along with a lambda function to check each value in the specified columns. If the value is 'Rising Pune Supergiant', it is replaced with 'Rising Pune Supergiants'. This ensures consistency in team names throughout the dataset.

CONTENT: The `analysis.py` file contains some initial code for reading the dataset and a comment section where we are supposed to implement the calculation of winning and losing probabilities.

The winning probability is calculated as the total matches won divided by the total matches played. Similarly, the losing probability is calculated as the total matches lost divided by the total matches played.

Let's start by calculating the total matches played by each team. We can do this by counting the number of times each team appears in the 'team1' and 'team2' columns in the `match_data` DataFrame. Then, we can calculate the total matches won by each team by counting the number of times each team appears in the 'winner' column. The total matches lost by each team is then the total matches played minus the total matches won.

Let's implement this in the `analysis.py` file.
