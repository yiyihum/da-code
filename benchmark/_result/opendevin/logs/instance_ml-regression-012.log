## About Dataset

You have access to two datasets: one exclusively containing car ratings, and the other containing detailed car features. These datasets provide an opportunity to work with real data, enabling you to practice various data analytics techniques such as data visualization, regression analysis for predicting prices, and classification tasks such as brand classification.

THOUGHT: The 'New_York_cars.csv' file contains several features that could potentially be used to predict the mileage of a vehicle. These include the type of vehicle (new or used), the name of the vehicle, the price, the exterior and interior colors, the drivetrain, the MPG, the fuel type, the transmission, the engine, and the year.

Before we can use these features to train a model, we need to preprocess the data. This could involve handling missing values, converting categorical variables into a format that can be used by a machine learning model, and normalizing numerical features.

Let's start by checking for missing values in the dataset.

THOUGHT: The dataset contains many missing values. For the purpose of this task, we will focus on the columns that have fewer missing values and are more likely to have an impact on the mileage of a vehicle. These include 'new&used', 'money', 'Drivetrain', 'Fuel type', 'Transmission', 'Engine', 'brand', 'Year', and 'Model'. 

We will fill the missing values in these columns with appropriate values. For categorical columns like 'Drivetrain', 'Fuel type', 'Transmission', and 'Engine', we will fill the missing values with the most frequent value in the column. For the 'money' column, which is a numerical column, we will fill the missing values with the median of the column.

Let's start by filling the missing values in these columns.
CODE:
# Fill missing values
df['Drivetrain'].fillna(df['Drivetrain'].mode()[0], inplace=True)
df['Fuel type'].fillna(df['Fuel type'].mode()[0], inplace=True)
df['Transmission'].fillna(df['Transmission'].mode()[0], inplace=True)
df['Engine'].fillna(df['Engine'].mode()[0], inplace=True)
df['money'].fillna(df['money'].median(), inplace=True)

# Check for missing values again
df.isnull().sum()

We'll convert these variables into a format that can be used by a machine learning model. We'll use one-hot encoding for this purpose, which involves creating a binary column for each category of each categorical variable.

CODE:
# Define the features and the target

THOUGHT: The missing values in the target have been filled. Now, we can proceed to train a machine learning model. For this task, we'll use a simple linear regression model from the scikit-learn library. 

Before we train the model, we need to split the data into a training set and a validation set. This will allow us to evaluate the performance of the model. We'll use 80% of the data for training and 20% for validation.

Let's split the data and train the model.
CODE:
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error

# Split the data into a training set and a validation set
X_train, X_val, y_train, y_val = train_test_split(X_encoded, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Train a linear regression model
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions on the validation set
y_pred = model.predict(X_val)

# Calculate the root mean squared error on the validation set
rmse = mean_squared_error(y_val, y_pred, squared=False)

THOUGHT: It seems like the training process took too long and was interrupted. This could be due to the large number of features in the dataset after one-hot encoding. 

To address this issue, we can try using a simpler model or reducing the dimensionality of the data. For this task, let's try using a simpler model. We'll use a decision tree regressor, which can handle categorical variables without the need for one-hot encoding.

Let's train a decision tree regressor on the original features (before one-hot encoding).
CODE:
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeRegressor
from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder

# Encode the categorical features
le = LabelEncoder()
X_encoded = X.apply(le.fit_transform)

# Split the data into a training set and a validation set
X_train, X_val, y_train, y_val = train_test_split(X_encoded, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Train a decision tree regressor
model = DecisionTreeRegressor()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions on the validation set
y_pred = model.predict(X_val)

# Calculate the root mean squared error on the validation set
rmse = mean_squared_error(y_val, y_pred, squared=False)
