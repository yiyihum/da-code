1|## About Dataset
2|
3|Hello
4|I am a Python developer and train the ability to parse, analyze data and create neural networks. I decided to share the dataset I'm currently working with. Maybe it will be useful to someone. Why a car? I love cars! As well as programming. If you are interested in me as a specialist, please contact me** **[glotoffalexandr@gmail.com](mailto:glotoffalexandr@gmail.com) (I'm looking for a new job)
5|
6|The dataset was assembled in January 2022. Data from a well-known car sale site in Poland (which is public). Selenium and request were used for parsing (python of course)
7|
8|The dataset contains information about the make, model, generation, year of production, mileage, engine type and volume, localization and price
9|
10|I have ideas for expanding the model: add body type, configuration, color, power, etc.
11|
12|I see many ways to use models created on the basis of this dataset, I will describe them in notebooks

CONTENT: The training data contains the following columns: 'Unnamed: 0', 'mark', 'model', 'generation_name', 'year', 'mileage', 'vol_engine', 'fuel', 'city', 'province', and 'price'. 

The 'price' column is the target variable that we need to predict for the test data. 

Now, let's build a machine learning model to predict car prices. We will use a simple linear regression model for this task. 

First, we need to preprocess the data. We will drop the 'Unnamed: 0' column as it seems to be an index. We will also drop the 'city' and 'province' columns as they are categorical and would require more complex preprocessing to be used in a linear regression model. 

Then, we will convert the categorical columns 'mark', 'model', 'generation_name', and 'fuel' into numerical values using one-hot encoding. 

Finally, we will split the data into features (X) and target (y), and train the model. 

Let's start with data preprocessing.
