## About Dataset

This dataset contains headlines, URLs, and categories for 422,937 news stories collected by a web aggregator between March 10th, 2014 and August 10th, 2014.

News categories included in this dataset include business; science and technology; entertainment; and health. Different news articles that refer to the same news item (e.g., several articles about recently released employment statistics) are also categorized together.

## Content

The columns included in this dataset are:

* **ID** : the numeric ID of the article
* **TITLE** : the headline of the article
* **URL** : the URL of the article
* **PUBLISHER** : the publisher of the article
* **CATEGORY** : the category of the news item; one of:
  --** ***b* : business
  --** ***t* : science and technology
  --** ***e* : entertainment
  --** ***m* : health
* **STORY** : alphanumeric ID of the news story that the article discusses
* **HOSTNAME** : hostname where the article was posted
* **TIMESTAMP** : approximate timestamp of the article's publication, given in Unix time (seconds since midnight on Jan 1, 1970)

## Acknowledgments

This dataset comes from the** **[UCI Machine Learning Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml). Any publications that use this data should cite the repository as follows:

Lichman, M. (2013). UCI Machine Learning Repository [[http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml]](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml]). Irvine, CA: University of California, School of Information and Computer Science.

This specific dataset can be found in the UCI ML Repository at** **[this URL](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/News+Aggregator)

## Inspiration

What kinds of questions can we explore using this dataset? Here are a few possibilities:

* can we predict the category (business, entertainment, etc.) of a news article given only its headline?
* can we predict the specific story that a news article refers to, given only its headline?

THOUGHT: The README.md file provides a good overview of the dataset. The dataset contains news stories with their headlines, URLs, publishers, categories, story IDs, hostnames, and timestamps. The categories are represented as 'b' for business, 't' for science and technology, 'e' for entertainment, and 'm' for health.

The task is to predict the category of the news articles in the test.csv file based on their text information and write the predicted results into a file named category.csv.

Let's now examine the test.csv file to understand its structure and the kind of data it contains.

THOUGHT: The test.csv file contains seven columns: ID, TITLE, URL, PUBLISHER, STORY, HOSTNAME, and TIMESTAMP. However, the CATEGORY column, which we need to predict, is missing.

To solve this task, we need to use a machine learning model trained on a similar dataset with known categories. However, we don't have such a model or a training dataset in the current environment.

Let's check if there are any other files in the environment that we can use.

THOUGHT: The `test.csv` file has been successfully loaded into a pandas DataFrame. The DataFrame contains seven columns: ID, TITLE, URL, PUBLISHER, STORY, HOSTNAME, and TIMESTAMP. The CATEGORY column, which we need to predict, is missing.

The next step is to train a machine learning model on the training dataset and then use the trained model to predict the categories of the news articles in the test dataset. Given that the task is a text classification task, a suitable model for this task could be a Naive Bayes classifier, which is often used for text classification tasks. However, before we can train the model, we need to preprocess the text data in the TITLE column of the training dataset.

Let's start by installing the necessary libraries for text preprocessing and model training.

THOUGHT: Now that scikit-learn is installed, let's preprocess the text data in the TITLE column of the training dataset. We'll convert the text to lowercase, remove punctuation and stopwords, and perform stemming. Then, we'll convert the preprocessed text data into a matrix of TF-IDF features, which can be used to train the machine learning model.
CODE:
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
from sklearn.naive_bayes import MultinomialNB
from sklearn.pipeline import make_pipeline
from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder

# Preprocess the text data and convert it into a matrix of TF-IDF features
vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer(stop_words='english', lowercase=True)

# Encode the target variable
encoder = LabelEncoder()

# Train a Naive Bayes classifier
model = make_pipeline(vectorizer, MultinomialNB())

# Fit the model to the training data
model.fit(df['TITLE'], encoder.fit_transform(df['CATEGORY']))

# Predict the categories of the news articles in the test dataset
predicted_categories = model.predict(df_test['TITLE'])

# Convert the predicted categories back to their original labels
predicted_labels = encoder.inverse_transform(predicted_categories)

# Create a DataFrame with the predicted results
df_results = pd.DataFrame(predicted_labels, columns=['CATEGORY'])

# Write the predicted results into a file named category.csv
df_results.to_csv('category.csv', index=False)
