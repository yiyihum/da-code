## About Dataset

### Context

This dataset contains tree observations from four areas of the Roosevelt National Forest in Colorado. All observations are cartographic variables (no remote sensing) from 30 meter x 30 meter sections of forest. There are over half a million measurements total!

### Content

This dataset includes information on tree type, shadow coverage, distance to nearby landmarks (roads etcetera), soil type, and local topography.

### Acknowledgement

This dataset is part of the UCI Machine Learning Repository, and the original source can be found** **[here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Covertype). The original database owners are Jock A. Blackard, Dr. Denis J. Dean, and Dr. Charles W. Anderson of the Remote Sensing and GIS Program at Colorado State University.** **

### Inspiration

* Can you build a model that predicts what types of trees grow in an area based on the surrounding characteristics? A past Kaggle competition project on this topic can be found** **[here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/forest-cover-type-prediction).
* What kinds of trees are most common in the Roosevelt National Forest?
* Which tree types can grow in more diverse environments? Are there certain tree types that are sensitive to an environmental factor, such as elevation or soil type?

CONTENT: The README.md file provides a brief description of the dataset. It contains tree observations from four areas of the Roosevelt National Forest in Colorado. The dataset includes information on tree type, shadow coverage, distance to nearby landmarks (roads etcetera), soil type, and local topography.

Now, let's check the actual dataset. I will list the files in the current directory to find the dataset file.

CONTENT: The dataset contains 55 columns, including various features such as 'Elevation', 'Aspect', 'Slope', 'Horizontal_Distance_To_Hydrology', 'Vertical_Distance_To_Hydrology', 'Horizontal_Distance_To_Roadways', 'Hillshade_9am', 'Hillshade_Noon', 'Hillshade_3pm', 'Horizontal_Distance_To_Fire_Points', 'Soil_Type' (from 1 to 40), and 'Cover_Type'. 

The 'Cover_Type' column seems to be the target variable indicating the type of forest cover. However, since we are performing a clustering task, we don't need this column. 

Let's drop the 'Cover_Type' column and perform clustering on the remaining features. I will use the KMeans algorithm from the sklearn library for clustering. If sklearn is not installed, I will install it first. 

Before that, let's determine the optimal number of clusters using the Elbow method. The Elbow method involves running the KMeans algorithm multiple times over a loop, with an increasing number of cluster choice and then plotting a clustering score as a function of the number of clusters. The "elbow" point is the point of inflection, which gives us an indication of the optimal number of clusters. 

Let's start by installing the necessary libraries (if not already installed) and then proceed with the Elbow method.

CONTENT: Now that we have installed the necessary libraries, let's proceed with the Elbow method to determine the optimal number of clusters. 

Due to the large size of the dataset, running KMeans for a large range of cluster numbers might be computationally expensive and time-consuming. Therefore, I will initially run the Elbow method for a range of 1 to 10 clusters. If the "elbow" point is not clear within this range, we can consider increasing the range.

Let's start by importing the necessary libraries and defining the range of clusters. Then, we will run KMeans for each number of clusters and calculate the sum of squared distances of samples to their closest cluster center (inertia). We will plot these values to visualize the "elbow" point. 

Please note that due to the large size of the dataset, this operation might take some time.

CONTENT: The Elbow method plot shows that the inertia decreases significantly as the number of clusters increases. However, the rate of decrease slows down after around 3 clusters, suggesting that 3 might be a good choice for the number of clusters.

Now, let's perform KMeans clustering with 3 clusters and write the clustering results into `cluster.csv`, with the columns named "Feature_i" (where i indicates the ith value of the feature vector) and "Cluster" (the label of the cluster obtained from clustering).
