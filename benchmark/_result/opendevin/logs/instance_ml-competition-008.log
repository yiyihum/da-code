## Dataset Description

The dataset for this competition (both train and test) was generated from a deep learning model trained on the** **[Flood Prediction Factors](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/brijlaldhankour/flood-prediction-factors) dataset. Feature distributions are close to, but not exactly the same, as the original. Feel free to use the original dataset as part of this competition, both to explore differences as well as to see whether incorporating the original in training improves model performance.

**Note:** This dataset is particularly well suited for visualizations, clustering, and general EDA. Show off your skills!

## Files

* **train.csv** - the training dataset;** **`FloodProbability` is the target
* **test.csv** - the test dataset; your objective is to predict the** **`FloodProbability` for each row
* **sample_submission.csv** - a sample submission file in the correct format

THOUGHT: The test data contains 21 columns, including the `id` and the same 20 features as in the training data. The `FloodProbability` column is missing, which is what we need to predict.

Now, let's proceed with the data analysis and model training. We'll use a simple linear regression model for this task. First, we need to separate the features and the target variable in the training data. Then, we'll train the model on the training data. After that, we'll use the trained model to predict the `FloodProbability` for the test data.

Let's start by separating the features and the target variable in the training data.
CODE:
# Separate the features and the target variable
X_train = train_data.drop(['id', 'FloodProbability'], axis=1)
y_train = train_data['FloodProbability']

THOUGHT: Now, let's train a linear regression model on the training data. We'll use the scikit-learn library for this. If it's not installed, we'll need to install it first.
CODE:

    from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
except ModuleNotFoundError:
    !pip install scikit-learn
    from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

# Create a linear regression model
model = LinearRegression()
