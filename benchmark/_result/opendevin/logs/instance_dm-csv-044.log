1|# Customer Segmentation
2|
3|The most successful companies today are the ones that know their customers so well that they can anticipate their needs. Data analysts play a key role in unlocking these in-depth insights, and segmenting the customers to better serve them. In this course, you will learn real-world techniques on customer segmentation and behavioral analytics, using a real dataset containing anonymized customer transactions from an online retailer. You will first run cohort analysis to understand customer trends. You will then learn how to build easy to interpret customer segments. On top of that, you will prepare the segments you created, making them ready for machine learning. Finally, you will make your segments more powerful with k-means clustering, in just few lines of code! By the end of this course, you will be able to apply practical customer behavioral analytics and segmentation techniques.

THOUGHT: The data has been successfully loaded into a pandas DataFrame. Now, let's proceed with the task. We need to calculate the average unit price paid for items by groups of customers over time, where each group is determined by the month of their first purchase.

First, we need to convert the 'InvoiceDate' column to datetime format and extract the month and year. Then, we'll group the data by 'CustomerID' and 'InvoiceMonth' and calculate the average 'UnitPrice'. Let's do this step by step.

First, let's convert the 'InvoiceDate' column to datetime format and extract the month and year.
CODE:
# Convert 'InvoiceDate' to datetime format
df['InvoiceDate'] = pd.to_datetime(df['InvoiceDate'])

# Extract the month and year from 'InvoiceDate'
df['InvoiceMonth'] = df['InvoiceDate'].dt.to_period('M')

df.head()

THOUGHT: The 'InvoiceDate' column has been successfully converted to datetime format and the 'InvoiceMonth' column has been created. 

Next, we need to find the first purchase month for each customer. We'll create a new DataFrame that holds the 'CustomerID' and 'FirstPurchaseMonth' columns.
CODE:
# Create a new DataFrame for the first purchase month of each customer
df_first_purchase = df.groupby('CustomerID')['InvoiceMonth'].min().reset_index()
df_first_purchase.columns = ['CustomerID', 'FirstPurchaseMonth']

df_first_purchase.head()

THOUGHT: The 'FirstPurchaseMonth' for each customer has been successfully calculated. 

Next, we need to merge this DataFrame with the original DataFrame to associate each transaction with the first purchase month of the customer. Then, we'll group the data by 'FirstPurchaseMonth' and calculate the average 'UnitPrice'.
CODE:
# Merge the original DataFrame with the first purchase DataFrame
df = pd.merge(df, df_first_purchase, on='CustomerID')

# Group by 'FirstPurchaseMonth' and calculate the average 'UnitPrice'
df_avg_price = df.groupby('FirstPurchaseMonth')['UnitPrice'].mean().reset_index()

df_avg_price.head()
