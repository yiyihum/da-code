## About Dataset

This project is all about taking a closer look at the books available on Amazon. We've collected information on different types of genres, sub-genres, and individual books like their titles, authors, prices, and ratings. By digging into this data, we hope to learn interesting things about what kinds of books are popular, how they're priced, and what people like to read. This can help us understand more about the world of books and what makes them tick on Amazon.

### Dataset 1: Genre

- **Title**: This column contains the main genres of books available on Amazon.
- **Number of Sub-genres**: Indicates the count of sub-genres associated with each main genre.
- **URL**: Provides the link to the page on Amazon where books of this genre are listed.

### Dataset 2: SubGenre

- **Title**: Lists the specific sub-genres within each main genre.
- **Main Genre**: Indicates the overarching genre to which each sub-genre belongs.
- **No. of Books**: Shows the count of books categorized under each sub-genre.
- **URL**: Provides the link to the page on Amazon where books of this sub-genre are listed.

### Dataset 3: Books_df

- **Title**: The title of the book.
- **Author**: Name of the author or publication house.
- **Main Genre**: The main genre the book belongs to.
- **Sub Genre**: The specific sub-genre of the book.
- **Type**: Indicates the format of the book, such as paperback, Kindle, audiobook, or hardcover.
- **Price**: The price of the book.
- **Rating**: The average rating of the book given by users.
- **No. of People Rated**: Indicates the count of users who have rated the book.
- **URLs**: Provides the link to the book's page on Amazon for further details and purchase options.

### Defination

**Best-Rated Authors**: These are authors who have received the highest average ratings. Average ratings are calculated based on the feedback from readers or users who rate the authors' books. To qualify as a best-rated author, an individual will typically need to have a significant number of high ratings to ensure that the rating is reliable. 

**Most Expensive Authors**: These authors are associated with the highest average prices for their books. The average price is determined by the cost of the authors' published works. Most expensive authors typically are those whose books are sold at a premium price, often reflecting factors such as the author's fame, the book's quality, genre, or collector's value. 

**Most Rated Authors**: These are authors who have the highest total number of ratings across all their books. This is indicative of popularity and the extent of readership and engagement the author has garnered. A high number of ratings does not necessarily reflect the quality or price of the books but does show that a large number of readers have provided feedback.

THOUGHT: The README.md file provides a detailed explanation of the dataset and the definitions of Best-Rated Authors, Most Expensive Authors, and Most Rated Authors. Now, let's check the guidance.txt file to understand the steps we need to follow to solve the problem.
COMMAND:
cat guidance.txt
2024-06-15 18:46:42,875 - INFO - **CmdOutputObservation (exit code=0)**
The previous code calculates the three categories of best authors through the following steps:
Group the data by author and calculate each author's average rating, average price, total number of ratings, and average ratings per book.
Set a threshold for the number of ratings (1000) to ensure only authors with a significant number of ratings are considered, enhancing the reliability of the results.
  
- **Best Rated Authors**: Sort the filtered data by average rating and extract the top 10 authors with the highest ratings.
- **Most Expensive Authors**: Sort by average price and extract the top 10 authors with the highest prices.
- **Most Rated Authors**: Sort by total number of ratings and extract the top 10 authors with the most ratings.

THOUGHT: The sample_result.csv file shows that the expected output should have columns for 'Best-Rated Author', 'Most Expensive Author', and 'Most Rated Author'. The 'id' column seems to be a ranking from 0 to 9 (for the top 10 authors in each category).

Now, let's check the available datasets in the environment. We are particularly interested in the 'Books_df' dataset as described in the README.md file, as it contains the book details including author, price, rating, and number of people who rated the book.

Now, let's follow the steps outlined in the guidance.txt file to calculate the top 10 Best-Rated Authors, Most Expensive Authors, and Most Rated Authors. 

First, we need to clean the data. Specifically, we need to remove the '₹' symbol from the 'Price' column and convert the prices to numeric values. We also need to handle any missing values in the dataset. Let's start with these steps.
CODE:
# Remove the '₹' symbol from the 'Price' column
books_df['Price'] = books_df['Price'].str.replace('₹', '')

# Convert the 'Price' column to a numeric type
books_df['Price'] = pd.to_numeric(books_df['Price'])

# Check for missing values in the dataset
missing_values = books_df.isnull().sum()

THOUGHT: The author_data dataframe contains each author's average rating, average price, and total number of ratings. 

Now, let's set a threshold for the number of ratings to ensure only authors with a significant number of ratings are considered. According to the guidance.txt file, we should set this threshold to 1000. Let's filter the author_data dataframe based on this threshold.
CODE:
# Set a threshold for the number of ratings
threshold = 1000

# Filter the author_data dataframe based on the threshold
filtered_author_data = author_data[author_data['No. of People rated'] >= threshold]

# Display the first few rows of the filtered_author_data dataframe
filtered_author_data.head()

THOUGHT: Now that we have filtered the data, let's calculate the top 10 Best-Rated Authors, Most Expensive Authors, and Most Rated Authors.

- **Best-Rated Authors**: We'll sort the filtered data by average rating and extract the top 10 authors with the highest ratings.
- **Most Expensive Authors**: We'll sort by average price and extract the top 10 authors with the highest prices.
- **Most Rated Authors**: We'll sort by total number of ratings and extract the top 10 authors with the most ratings.

Let's start with the Best-Rated Authors.
CODE:
# Calculate the top 10 Best-Rated Authors
best_rated_authors = filtered_author_data.sort_values(by='Rating', ascending=False).head(10)['Author'].tolist()

Now, let's calculate the top 10 Most Expensive Authors.
