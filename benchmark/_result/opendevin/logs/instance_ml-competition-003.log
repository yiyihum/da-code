## Overview

### Description

### Goal of the Competition

The goal of this competition is to predict if a person has any of three medical conditions. You are being asked to predict if the person has one or more of any of the three medical conditions (Class 1), or none of the three medical conditions (Class 0). You will create a model trained on measurements of health characteristics.

To determine if someone has these medical conditions requires a long and intrusive process to collect information from patients. With predictive models, we can shorten this process and keep patient details private by collecting key characteristics relative to the conditions, then encoding these characteristics.

Your work will help researchers discover the relationship between measurements of certain characteristics and potential patient conditions.

## Context

They say age is just a number but a whole host of health issues come with aging. From heart disease and dementia to hearing loss and arthritis, aging is a risk factor for numerous diseases and complications. The growing field of bioinformatics includes research into interventions that can help slow and reverse biological aging and prevent major age-related ailments. Data science could have a role to play in developing new methods to solve problems with diverse data, even if the number of samples is small.

Currently, models like XGBoost and random forest are used to predict medical conditions yet the models' performance is not good enough. Dealing with critical problems where lives are on the line, models need to make correct predictions reliably and consistently between different cases.

Founded in 2015, competition host** **[InVitro Cell Research, LLC (ICR)](https://invitrocellresearch.com/) is a privately funded company focused on regenerative and preventive personalized medicine. Their offices and labs in the greater New York City area offer state-of-the-art research space. InVitro Cell Research's Scientists are what set them apart, helping guide and defining their mission of researching how to repair aging people fast.

In this competition, you’ll work with measurements of health characteristic data to solve critical problems in bioinformatics. Based on minimal training, you’ll create a model to predict if a person has any of three medical conditions, with an aim to improve on existing methods.

You could help advance the growing field of bioinformatics and explore new methods to solve complex problems with diverse data.

> **This is a Code Competition. Refer to** **[Code Requirements](https://kaggle.com/competitions/icr-identify-age-related-conditions/overview/code-requirements) for details.**

### Evaluation

link

keyboard_arrow_up

Submissions are evaluated using a** ** **balanced logarithmic loss** . The overall effect is such that each class is roughly equally important for the final score.

Each observation is either of class** **`0` or of class** **`1`. For each observation, you must submit a probability for each class. The formula is then:

**Log Loss**=**−**1**𝑁**0**∑**𝑁**0**𝑖**=**1**𝑦**0**𝑖**log**𝑝**0**𝑖**−**1**𝑁**1**∑**𝑁**1**𝑖**=**1**𝑦**1**𝑖**log**𝑝**1**𝑖**2**

where (N_{c}) is the number of observations of class (c), (\log) is the natural logarithm, (y_{c i}) is 1 if observation (i) belongs to class (c) and 0 otherwise, (p_{c i}) is the predicted probability that observation (i) belongs to class (c).

The submitted probabilities for a given row are not required to sum to one because they are rescaled prior to being scored (each row is divided by the row sum). In order to avoid the extremes of the log function, each predicted probability** **𝑝** **is replaced with** **max**(**min**(**𝑝**,**1**−**10**−**15**)**,**10**−**15**).

## Submission File

For each** **`id` in the test set, you must predict a probability for each of the two classes. The file should contain a header and have the following format:

```
Id,class_0,class_1
00eed32682bb,0.5,0.5
010ebe33f668,0.5,0.5

THOUGHT: The README.md file provides a detailed description of the competition. The goal is to predict if a person has any of three medical conditions (Class 1), or none of the three medical conditions (Class 0) based on measurements of health characteristics. The evaluation metric is balanced logarithmic loss.

The submission file should contain a header and have the following format:

```
Id,class_0,class_1

THOUGHT: The test dataset contains 57 columns. The 'Id' column is the identifier for each person. The other columns are the health characteristics. We need to predict the target variables for each person in the test dataset.

Now, let's start building a predictive model. Given the nature of the problem (binary classification) and the evaluation metric (logarithmic loss), a good starting point could be a logistic regression model. However, the README mentioned that models like XGBoost and random forest have been used but their performance is not good enough. So, let's try using a more advanced model like Gradient Boosting.

Before we proceed, let's check if the necessary libraries (scikit-learn and xgboost) are installed.

THOUGHT: Now that the necessary libraries are installed, let's proceed with the model building. We'll start by preparing the data for training. We'll drop the 'id' and 'id.1' columns from the training dataset, and separate the target variables from the features. Then, we'll train a Gradient Boosting model using the XGBoost library.
CODE:
from xgboost import XGBClassifier
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import log_loss

# Prepare the data for training
X = train.drop(['id', 'Pastry', 'Z_Scratch', 'K_Scatch', 'Stains', 'Dirtiness', 'Bumps', 'Other_Faults', 'id.1'], axis=1)
y = train[['Pastry', 'Z_Scratch', 'K_Scatch', 'Stains', 'Dirtiness', 'Bumps', 'Other_Faults']]

# Split the data into training and validation sets
X_train, X_val, y_train, y_val = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Train a Gradient Boosting model
model = XGBClassifier(use_label_encoder=False, eval_metric='logloss')
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions on the validation set
y_val_pred = model.predict_proba(X_val)

# Calculate the log loss
loss = log_loss(y_val, y_val_pred)

THOUGHT: The 'Id' and 'EJ' columns in the test dataset are non-numeric. The 'Id' column is not a feature and will not be used in the prediction, so we only need to handle the 'EJ' column. 

Let's check the unique values in the 'EJ' column to decide how to handle it.

THOUGHT: The 'EJ' column contains two unique values: 'A' and 'B'. We can handle this column by encoding its values to numeric. A common approach for this is one-hot encoding, which creates a new binary column for each unique value in the column. However, since 'EJ' only has two unique values, we can simply replace 'A' with 0 and 'B' with 1. This will convert the column to numeric without increasing the dimensionality of the data.

Let's apply this transformation to both the training and test datasets, and then retrain the model.
CODE:
# Replace 'A' with 0 and 'B' with 1 in the 'EJ' column
train['EJ'] = train['EJ'].replace({'A': 0, 'B': 1})
test['EJ'] = test['EJ'].replace({'A': 0, 'B': 1})

# Prepare the data for training
X = train.drop(['id', 'Pastry', 'Z_Scratch', 'K_Scatch', 'Stains', 'Dirtiness', 'Bumps', 'Other_Faults', 'id.1'], axis=1)
y = train[['Pastry', 'Z_Scratch', 'K_Scatch', 'Stains', 'Dirtiness', 'Bumps', 'Other_Faults']]

# Split the data into training and validation sets

THOUGHT: It seems that the 'EJ' column in the test dataset still contains non-numeric values, which is causing the error. This could be due to a mistake in the previous step where we attempted to replace 'A' and 'B' with 0 and 1. Let's try that step again and make sure the replacement is done correctly.
CODE:
# Replace 'A' with 0 and 'B' with 1 in the 'EJ' column
test['EJ'] = test['EJ'].map({'A': 0, 'B': 1})
