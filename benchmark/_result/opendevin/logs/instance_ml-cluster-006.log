3|About Dataset
4|● Based on patient symptoms, identify patients needing immediate
5|resuscitation; to assign patients to a predesignated patient care
6|area, thereby prioritizing their care; and to initiate
7|diagnostic/therapeutic measures as appropriate.
8|● Three individual datasets used for three urgent illness/injury, each
9|dataset has its own features and symptoms for each patient and
10|we merged them to know what are the most severe symptoms for
11|each illness and give them priority of treatment.
12|
13|PROJECT SUMMARY
14|Triage refers to the sorting of injured or sick people according to their need for emergency medical
15|attention. It is a method of determining priority for who gets care first.
16|BACKGROUND
17|Triage is the prioritization of patient care (or victims during a disaster) based on illness/injury,
18|symptoms, severity, prognosis, and resource availability. The purpose of triage is to identify patients
19|needing immediate resuscitation; to assign patients to a predesignated patient care area, thereby
20|prioritizing their care; and to initiate diagnostic/therapeutic measures as appropriate.
21|BUSINESS CHALLENGE
22|Based on patient symptoms, identify patients needing immediate resuscitation; to assign patients to a
23|predesignated patient care area, thereby prioritizing their care; and to initiate diagnostic/therapeutic
24|measures as appropriate.

Since the task is to perform clustering, we need to preprocess the data to handle missing values and categorical variables. Also, we need to normalize the data before applying a clustering algorithm.

Let's start by checking the data types of the columns and looking for missing values.

CONTENT: The dataset contains both numerical and categorical variables. The 'gender', 'plasma_glucose', 'skin_thickness', 'insulin', and 'residence_type' columns have missing values.

For numerical columns with missing values, we can fill in the missing values with the mean of the column. For the categorical column with missing values, we can fill in the missing values with the most frequent category.

After handling missing values, we can convert categorical variables into numerical using one-hot encoding.

Let's start by handling the missing values.

CONTENT: The categorical variables have been successfully converted into numerical using one-hot encoding. Now, all the features are numerical and we can apply a clustering algorithm.

Before applying the clustering algorithm, it's a good practice to normalize the data. This is because clustering algorithms are distance-based, and features with larger scales can dominate the distance metric. 

Let's normalize the data. After that, we can apply a clustering algorithm. For this task, I will use KMeans clustering. The number of clusters is not specified, so I will use the Elbow method to determine the optimal number of clusters.
