1.1 Introduction

This database contains pitching, hitting, and fielding statistics for
Major League Baseball from 1871 through 2014.  It includes data from
the two current leagues (American and National), the four other "major" 
leagues (American Association, Union Association, Players League, and
Federal League), and the National Association of 1871-1875. 

This database was created by Sean Lahman, who pioneered the effort to
make baseball statistics freely available to the general public. What
started as a one man effort in 1994 has grown tremendously, and now a
team of researchers have collected their efforts to make this the
largest and most accurate source for baseball statistics available
anywhere. (See Acknowledgements below for a list of the key
contributors to this project.)

None of what we have done would have been possible without the
pioneering work of Hy Turkin, S.C. Thompson, David Neft, and Pete
Palmer (among others).  All baseball fans owe a debt of gratitude
to the people who have worked so hard to build the tremendous set
of data that we have today.  Our thanks also to the many members of
the Society for American Baseball Research who have helped us over
the years.  We strongly urge you to support and join their efforts.
Please vist their website (www.sabr.org).

If you have any problems or find any errors, please let us know.  Any 
feedback is appreciated

----------------------------------------------------------------------
1.2 What's New in 2014

Player stats have been updated through 2014 season.

Removed two deprecated fields from the batting table. The G_batting and
G_old fields were rendered obsolete when we created the appearances table.
They've beenremoved from the batting table starting with this version

SchoolsPlayers has been replaced with a new table called CollegePlaying.
This reflects advances in the compilation of this data, largely led by
Ted Turocy. The old table reported college attendance for major league
players by listing a start date and end date.  The new version has a 
separate record for each year that a player attended.  This allows
us to better account for players who attended multiple colleges or
skipped a season, as well as to identify teammates.


----------------------------------------------------------------------
1.3 Acknowledgements

Much of the raw data contained in this database comes from the work of
Pete Palmer, the legendary statistician, who has had a hand in most 
of the baseball encylopedias published since 1974. He is largely 
responsible for bringing the batting, pitching, and fielding data out
of the dark ages and into the computer era.  Without him, none of this
would be possible.  For more on Pete's work, please read his own 
account at: http://sabr.org/cmsfiles/PalmerDatabaseHistory.pdf

Three people have been key contributors to the work that followed, first 
by taking the raw data and creating a relational database, and later 
by extending the database to make it more accesible to researchers.

Sean Lahman launched the Baseball Archive's website back before 
most people had heard of the world wide web.  Frustrated by the
lack of sports data available, he led the effort to build a 
baseball database that everyone could use. Baseball researchers 
everywhere owe him a debt of gratitude.  Lahman served as an associate
editor for three editions of Total Baseball and contributed to five
editions of The ESPN Baseball Encyclopedia. He has also been active in
developing databases for other sports.

The work of Sean Forman to create and maintain an online encyclopedia
at "baseball-reference.com" has been remarkable. Recognized as the 
premier online reference source, Forman's site provides an oustanding
interface to the raw data. His efforts to help streamline the database
have been extremely helpful. Most importantly, Forman has spearheaded
the effort to provide standards that enable several different baseball
databases to be used together. He was also instrumental in launching
the Baseball Databank, a forum for researchers to gather and share
their work.

Since 2001, these two Seans have led a group of researchers
who volunteered to maintain and update the database. 

Ted Turocy has done the lion's share of the work to updating the main
data tables since 2012, including significant imporvements to the
demographic data in the master table. In his role as SABR data czar,
he led the effort to document college playing stints for all
major league players. Turocy also spearheads the Chadwick Baseball
Bureau. For more details on his tools and services, visit:
http://chadwick.sourceforge.net/doc/index.html  

A handful of researchers have made substantial contributions to 
maintain this database over years. Listed alphabetically, they 
are: Derek Adair, Mike Crain, Kevin Johnson, Rod Nelson, Tom Tango,
and Paul Wendt. These folks did much of the heavy lifting, and are 
largely responsible for the improvements made since 2000.

Others who made important contributions include: Dvd Avins, 
Clifford Blau, Bill Burgess, Clem Comly, Jeff Burk, Randy Cox, 
Mitch Dickerman, Paul DuBois, Mike Emeigh, F.X. Flinn, Bill Hickman,
Jerry Hoffman, Dan Holmes, Micke Hovmoller, Peter Kreutzer, 
Danile Levine, Bruce Macleod, Ken Matinale, Michael Mavrogiannis,
Cliff Otto, Alberto Perdomo, Dave Quinn, John Rickert, Tom Ruane,
Theron Skyles, Hans Van Slooten, Michael Westbay, and Rob Wood.

Many other people have made significant contributions to the database
over the years.  The contribution of Tom Ruane's effort to the overall
quality of the underlying data has been tremendous. His work at
retrosheet.org integrates the yearly data with the day-by-day data,
creating a reference source of startling depth. It is unlikely than 
any individual has contributed as much to the field of baseball 
research in the past five years as Ruane has.

Sean Holtz helped with a major overhaul and redesign before the
2000 season. Keith Woolner was instrumental in helping turn
a huge collection of stats into a relational database in the mid-1990s.
Clifford Otto & Ted Nye also helped provide guidance to the early 
versions. Lee Sinnis, John Northey & Erik Greenwood helped supply key
pieces of data. Many others have written in with corrections and 
suggestions that made each subsequent version even better than what
preceded it. 

The work of the SABR Baseball Records Committee, led by Lyle Spatz
has been invaluable.  So has the work of Bill Carle and the SABR 
Biographical Committee. David Vincent, keeper of the Home Run Log and
other bits of hard to find info, has always been helpful. The recent
addition of colleges to player bios is the result of much research by
members of SABR's Collegiate Baseball committee.

Salary data was first supplied by Doug Pappas, who passed away during
the summer of 2004. He was the leading authority on many subjects, 
most significantly the financial history of Major League Baseball. 
We are grateful that he allowed us to include some of the data he 
compiled.  His work has been continued by the SABR Business of 
Baseball committee.  

Thanks is also due to the staff at the National Baseball Library
in Cooperstown who have been so helpful over the years, including
Tim Wiles, Jim Gates, Bruce Markusen, and the rest of the staff.  

A special debt of gratitude is owed to Dave Smith and the folks at
Retrosheet. There is no other group working so hard to compile and
share baseball data.  Their website (www.retrosheet.org) will give
you a taste of the wealth of information Dave and the gang have collected.

Thanks to all contributors great and small. What you have created is
a wonderful thing.

1.4 Using this Database

This version of the database is available in Microsoft Access
format, SQL files or in a generic, comma delimited format. Because this is a
relational database, you will not be able to use the data in a
flat-database application. 

Please note that this is not a stand alone application.  It requires
a database application or some other application designed specifically
to interact with the database.

If you are unable to import the data directly, you should download the
database in the delimted text format.  Then use the documentation
in sections 2.1 through 2.22 of this document to import the data into
your database application.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.0 Data Tables

The design follows these general principles.  Each player is assigned a
unique number (playerID).  All of the information relating to that player
is tagged with his playerID.  The playerIDs are linked to names and 
birthdates in the MASTER table.

The database is comprised of the following main tables:

  MASTER - Player names, DOB, and biographical info
  Batting - batting statistics
  Pitching - pitching statistics
  Fielding - fielding statistics

It is supplemented by these tables:

  AllStarFull - All-Star appearances
  HallofFame - Hall of Fame voting data
  Managers - managerial statistics
  Teams - yearly stats and standings 
  BattingPost - post-season batting statistics
  PitchingPost - post-season pitching statistics
  TeamFranchises - franchise information
  FieldingOF - outfield position data  
  FieldingPost- post-season fieldinf data
  ManagersHalf - split season data for managers
  TeamsHalf - split season data for teams
  Salaries - player salary data
  SeriesPost - post-season series information
  AwardsManagers - awards won by managers 
  AwardsPlayers - awards won by players
  AwardsShareManagers - award voting for manager awards
  AwardsSharePlayers - award voting for player awards
  Appearances - details on the positions a player appeared at
  Schools - list of colleges that players attended
  CollegePlaying - list of players and the colleges they attended


Sections 2.1 through 2.24 of this document describe each of the tables in
detail and the fields that each contains.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.1 MASTER table

THOUGHT: The README.md file provides a detailed description of the dataset. It seems that the dataset is divided into multiple CSV files, each containing different types of data. 

To solve the task, we need to find the player with the most games played, the player with the most runs scored, the player with the most hits, and the player with the most home runs. 

The relevant data should be in the following tables:
- Batting.csv: This table should contain the data about games played, runs scored, hits, and home runs.
- Master.csv: This table should contain the player names.

Let's start by checking the contents of these two files.

THOUGHT: The `player.csv` file contains the following relevant columns:
- player_id: The player's ID.
- name_first: The player's first name.
- name_last: The player's last name.

Now, let's load the `player.csv` and `batting.csv` files into pandas dataframes and perform the necessary calculations.
CODE:

# Load the player.csv file
players = pd.read_csv('player.csv')

# Load the batting.csv file
batting = pd.read_csv('batting.csv')

# Calculate the player with the most games played
most_games = batting.groupby('player_id')['g'].sum().idxmax()
most_games_player = players[players['player_id'] == most_games][['name_first', 'name_last']].values[0]
most_games_count = batting[batting['player_id'] == most_games]['g'].sum()

# Calculate the player with the most runs scored
most_runs = batting.groupby('player_id')['r'].sum().idxmax()
most_runs_player = players[players['player_id'] == most_runs][['name_first', 'name_last']].values[0]
most_runs_count = batting[batting['player_id'] == most_runs]['r'].sum()

# Calculate the player with the most hits
most_hits = batting.groupby('player_id')['h'].sum().idxmax()
most_hits_player = players[players['player_id'] == most_hits][['name_first', 'name_last']].values[0]
most_hits_count = batting[batting['player_id'] == most_hits]['h'].sum()

# Calculate the player with the most home runs
most_hr = batting.groupby('player_id')['hr'].sum().idxmax()
most_hr_player = players[players['player_id'] == most_hr][['name_first', 'name_last']].values[0]
most_hr_count = batting[batting['player_id'] == most_hr]['hr'].sum()

# Create a dataframe for the results
results = pd.DataFrame({
    'player': [' '.join(most_games_player), ' '.join(most_runs_player), ' '.join(most_hits_player), ' '.join(most_hr_player)],
