1|## About Dataset
2|
3|## Dataset Information
4|
5|This dataset contains information on default payments, demographic factors, credit data, history of payment, and bill statements of credit card clients in Taiwan from April 2005 to September 2005.** **
6|
7|## Content
8|
9|There are 25 variables:
10|
11|* **ID** : ID of each client
12|* **LIMIT_BAL** : Amount of given credit in NT dollars (includes individual and family/supplementary credit
13|* **SEX** : Gender (1=male, 2=female)
14|* **EDUCATION** : (1=graduate school, 2=university, 3=high school, 4=others, 5=unknown, 6=unknown)
15|* **MARRIAGE** : Marital status (1=married, 2=single, 3=others)
16|* **AGE** : Age in years
17|* **PAY_0** : Repayment status in September, 2005 (-1=pay duly, 1=payment delay for one month, 2=payment delay for two months, â€¦ 8=payment delay for eight months, 9=payment delay for nine months and above)
18|* **PAY_2** : Repayment status in August, 2005 (scale same as above)
19|* **PAY_3** : Repayment status in July, 2005 (scale same as above)
20|* **PAY_4** : Repayment status in June, 2005 (scale same as above)
21|* **PAY_5** : Repayment status in May, 2005 (scale same as above)
22|* **PAY_6** : Repayment status in April, 2005 (scale same as above)
23|* **BILL_AMT1** : Amount of bill statement in September, 2005 (NT dollar)
24|* **BILL_AMT2** : Amount of bill statement in August, 2005 (NT dollar)
25|* **BILL_AMT3** : Amount of bill statement in July, 2005 (NT dollar)
26|* **BILL_AMT4** : Amount of bill statement in June, 2005 (NT dollar)
27|* **BILL_AMT5** : Amount of bill statement in May, 2005 (NT dollar)
28|* **BILL_AMT6** : Amount of bill statement in April, 2005 (NT dollar)
29|* **PAY_AMT1** : Amount of previous payment in September, 2005 (NT dollar)
30|* **PAY_AMT2** : Amount of previous payment in August, 2005 (NT dollar)
31|* **PAY_AMT3** : Amount of previous payment in July, 2005 (NT dollar)
32|* **PAY_AMT4** : Amount of previous payment in June, 2005 (NT dollar)
33|* **PAY_AMT5** : Amount of previous payment in May, 2005 (NT dollar)
34|* **PAY_AMT6** : Amount of previous payment in April, 2005 (NT dollar)
35|* **default.payment.next.month** : Default payment (1=yes, 0=no)
36|
37|## Inspiration
38|
39|Some ideas for exploration:
40|
41|1. How does the probability of default payment vary by categories of different demographic variables?
42|2. Which variables are the strongest predictors of default payment?
43|

CONTENT: The README.md file provides a detailed description of the dataset. It contains information on default payments, demographic factors, credit data, history of payment, and bill statements of credit card clients in Taiwan from April 2005 to September 2005.

The dataset has 25 variables, including ID, LIMIT_BAL, SEX, EDUCATION, MARRIAGE, AGE, PAY_0 to PAY_6, BILL_AMT1 to BILL_AMT6, PAY_AMT1 to PAY_AMT6, and default.payment.next.month. The variable "default.payment.next.month" is the target variable that we need to predict, which indicates whether a client will default (1=yes, 0=no).

Now, let's examine the test.csv file to understand the structure of the data we need to predict.

CONTENT: The test.csv file contains the same 24 variables as described in the README.md file, excluding the target variable "default.payment.next.month". We need to predict this target variable based on the given variables.

To solve this task, we need to follow these steps:

1. Load the training dataset and examine it.
2. Preprocess the data if necessary (e.g., handle missing values, convert categorical variables to numerical, etc.).
3. Train a machine learning model on the training dataset.
4. Load the test.csv file and apply the same preprocessing steps as the training data.
5. Use the trained model to predict the target variable for the test data.
6. Write the predicted results into a file named defaulter.csv, with the column name "IsDefaulter".

Let's start by loading the training dataset. We need to find the training dataset first. It should be in the same directory and have a similar name as the test.csv file. Let's list the files in the current directory.

CONTENT: The training dataset "UCI_Credit_Card.csv" is successfully loaded. It contains 25 columns, including the target variable "default.payment.next.month". 

Now, let's preprocess the data and train a machine learning model. For this task, we can use a simple model such as logistic regression. 

Before training the model, we need to split the data into features (X) and the target variable (y). Then, we can train the model using this data. 

However, it seems that the environment does not have the necessary libraries for machine learning (such as scikit-learn). We need to install these libraries first. Let's install scikit-learn.
