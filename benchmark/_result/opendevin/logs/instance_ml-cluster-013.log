CONTENT: Now that we have preprocessed the data, let's perform clustering using the KMeans algorithm. 

We'll use the Elbow method to determine the optimal number of clusters. This method involves running the KMeans algorithm multiple times with different numbers of clusters, and then plotting the within-cluster sum of squares (WCSS) against the number of clusters. The optimal number of clusters is usually where the plot forms an 'elbow'. 

Let's implement this.
