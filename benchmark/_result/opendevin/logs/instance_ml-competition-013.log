7|## Welcome to the 2023 edition of Kaggle's Playground Series!
8|
9|Thank you to everyone who participated in and contributed to Season 3 Playground Series so far!** **
10|
11|With the same goal to give the Kaggle community a variety of fairly light-weight challenges that can be used to learn and sharpen skills in different aspects of machine learning and data science, we will continue launching the Tabular Tuesday in July every Tuesday 00:00 UTC, with each competition running for 3 weeks. Again, these will be fairly light-weight datasets that are synthetically generated from real-world data, and will provide an opportunity to quickly iterate through various model and feature engineering ideas, create visualizations, etc.** 
12|
13|## Evaluation
14|

16|
17|keyboard_arrow_up
18|
19|Submissions are evaluated on** **[SMAPE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetric_mean_absolute_percentage_error) between forecasts and actual values. We define SMAPE = 0 when the actual and predicted values are both 0.
20|
21|## Submission File
22|
23|For each** **`id` in the test set, you must predict the corresponding** **`num_sold`. The file should contain a header and have the following format:
24|
25|```
26|id,num_sold
27|136950,100
28|136950,100
29|136950,100
30|etc.
31|```

```

Next, let's take a look at the files in the dataset. I will list the files in the current directory.

CONTENT: The test.csv file contains the following columns:

- id: The ID of the sale.
- date: The date of the sale.
- country: The country where the sale was made.
- store: The store where the sale was made.
- product: The product that was sold.

The test.csv file does not contain the 'num_sold' column, which is our target variable. We need to predict this variable.

Now, let's start building a model to predict the 'num_sold' column. We will use a simple linear regression model for this task. But before that, we need to preprocess our data. We will convert the categorical variables into numerical variables using one-hot encoding, and we will convert the 'date' column into three separate columns: 'year', 'month', and 'day'. 

Let's start with the preprocessing.
