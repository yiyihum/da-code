2|Project Description
3|---
4|Open source projects contain entire development histories - who made changes, the changes themselves, 
5|and code reviews. In this project, will be challenged to read in, clean up, and visualize the real-world 
6|project repository of Scala that spans data from a version control system (Git) as well as a project hosting 
7|site (GitHub). With almost 30,000 commits and a history spanning over ten years, Scala is a mature language. 
8|Will find out who has had the most influence on its development and who are the experts.
9|
10|The dataset includes the project history of Scala retrieved from Git and GitHub as a set of CSV files.

CONTENT: The `pulls.csv` file contains three columns: `pid`, `user`, and `date`. The `pid` column represents the pull request id, the `user` column represents the user who made the pull request, and the `date` column represents the date when the pull request was made.

To find the users who made the last 6 pull requests for the specific file "src/compiler/scala/reflect/reify/phases/Calculate.scala", we need to:

1. Filter the `pull_files_df` DataFrame to include only the rows where the `file` column is "src/compiler/scala/reflect/reify/phases/Calculate.scala".
2. Merge this filtered DataFrame with the `pulls_df` DataFrame on the `pid` column to get the corresponding user and date for each pull request.
3. Sort the merged DataFrame by the `date` column in descending order to get the last 6 pull requests.
4. Extract the `user` column of the top 6 rows as the users who made the last 6 pull requests.

Let's perform these steps.
