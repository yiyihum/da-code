3|The dataset for this competition (both train and test) was generated from a deep learning model trained on the** **[Crab Age Prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sidhus/crab-age-prediction) dataset. Feature distributions are close to, but not exactly the same, as the original. Feel free to use the original dataset as part of this competition, both to explore differences as well as to see whether incorporating the original in training improves model performance.

THOUGHT: The README.md file provides a description of the problem and the files available. We are tasked with predicting the age of crabs based on the provided datasets. The target variable is 'Age'. The training dataset is 'train.csv', and the test dataset is 'test.csv'. The format of the submission should be similar to 'sample_submission.csv'.

Let's start by examining the contents of these files. I'll begin with 'train.csv'.

THOUGHT: There are no missing values in the training data. This is good as it means we don't need to handle missing data imputation.

Now, let's proceed with the model building process. I'll start by encoding the categorical 'Sex' column into numerical values, as machine learning algorithms work better with numerical data. Then, I'll split the training data into features (X) and the target variable (y). After that, I'll train a simple linear regression model as a starting point.

from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

# Encode the 'Sex' column
le = LabelEncoder()
train_data['Sex'] = le.fit_transform(train_data['Sex'])

# Split the data into features (X) and the target variable (y)
X = train_data.drop(['id', 'Age'], axis=1)
y = train_data['Age']

# Split the data into training and validation sets
X_train, X_val, y_train, y_val = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Train a linear regression model

THOUGHT: I apologize for the confusion. I should have used the root_mean_squared_error function instead of the mean_squared_error function with the 'squared' parameter. Let's correct this.

from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error

# Calculate the root mean squared error (RMSE)
rmse = mean_squared_error(y_val, y_val_pred, squared=False)
