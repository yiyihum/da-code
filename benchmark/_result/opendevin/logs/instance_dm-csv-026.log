## About Dataset

### Context

The datasets provided include the players data for the Career Mode from FIFA 15 to FIFA 22 ("players_22.csv"). The data allows multiple comparisons for the same players across the last 8 version of the videogame.

Some ideas of possible analysis:

* Historical comparison between Messi and Ronaldo (what skill attributes changed the most during time - compared to real-life stats);
* Ideal budget to create a competitive team (at the level of top n teams in Europe) and at which point the budget does not allow to buy significantly better players for the 11-men lineup. An extra is the same comparison with the Potential attribute for the lineup instead of the Overall attribute;
* Sample analysis of top n% players (e.g. top 5% of the player) to see if some important attributes as Agility or BallControl or Strength have been popular or not acroos the FIFA versions. An example would be seeing that the top 5% players of FIFA 20 are faster (higher Acceleration and Agility) compared to FIFA 15. The trend of attributes is also an important indication of how some attributes are necessary for players to win games (a version with more top 5% players with high BallControl stats would indicate that the game is more focused on the technique rather than the physicial aspect).

### Content

* Every player available in FIFA 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, and also FIFA 22
* 100+ attributes
* URL of the scraped players
* URL of the uploaded player faces, club and nation logos
* Player positions, with the role in the club and in the national team
* Player attributes with statistics as Attacking, Skills, Defense, Mentality, GK Skills, etc.
* Player personal data like Nationality, Club, DateOfBirth, Wage, Salary, etc.

Updates from previous FIFA 21 dataset are the following:

* Inclusion of FIFA 22 data
* Inclusion of all female players
* Columns reorder - to increase readability
* Removal of duplicate GK attribute fields
* The field** ***defending marking* has been renamed** ***defending marking awareness* and includes both the** ***marking* (old attribute name - up to FIFA 19) and** ***defensive awareness* values (new attribute name - from FIFA 20)
* All data from FIFA 15 was re-scraped, as one Kaggle user noted in** **[this discussion](https://www.kaggle.com/stefanoleone992/fifa-21-complete-player-dataset/discussion/232504) that sofifa updated some historical player market values over time

CONTENT: The README.md file provides a detailed description of the dataset. It contains data for the Career Mode from FIFA 15 to FIFA 22, including every player available in these versions, with over 100 attributes. The data includes player positions, roles in the club and national team, player attributes with statistics such as Attacking, Skills, Defense, Mentality, GK Skills, etc., and personal data like Nationality, Club, DateOfBirth, Wage, Salary, etc.

The task is to complete the analysis.py script to rank the players based on the specified score at the position level from 2015 to 2022. 

Let's take a look at the analysis.py file to understand what it currently contains.

Explanation:
Role Level Score Calculation Factors: These are the specific attributes or skills considered to calculate the role level score for each position. The attributes are summed up to form the total role level score.
Role Percentage Calculation Factors: The role percentage is calculated by taking the role level score, dividing it by the maximum possible score for that position, and then multiplying by 100 to get a percentage. This normalization allows comparison across different positions. For instance, goalkeepers' scores are out of 600, while midfielders' scores are out of 800.

### Workflow for Processing and Analyzing FIFA Data

1. **Union of Data Across Years and Genders** :
2. **Standardizing Player Positions** :

* Use a `CASE` statement to map position abbreviations (like LCM, CAM, GK) to full position names (like Left Center Midfield, Central Attacking Midfielder, Goal Keeper).

1. **Selecting and Combining Relevant Data** :
2. **Calculating Role Level Scores** :

* Icalculate the role level score for each player based on their position:
  * **Goal Keepers** : Sum of goalkeeping attributes (diving, handling, kicking, positioning, reflexes, speed).
  * **Defenders** : Sum of defending attributes (defending, marking, standing tackle, sliding tackle).
  * **Midfielders** : Sum of movement and skill attributes (acceleration, sprint speed, agility, reactions, balance, shooting, passing, dribbling).
  * **Strikers** : Sum of attacking attributes (pace, shooting, passing, dribbling, finishing, heading accuracy, strength).
  * **Forwards** : Similar to strikers but tailored to their specific attributes.
  * **Wingers** : Emphasis on pace, dribbling, and attacking skills.
  * **Other Positions** : Calculations based on specific position requirements (e.g., Long Snapper, Safety, Substitute).

1. **Calculating Role Level Percentages** :

* Normalize the role level scores by dividing by the maximum possible score for each position and multiplying by 100 to get a percentage.

CONTENT: The `workflow.md` file provides a detailed workflow for processing and analyzing the FIFA data. The steps include:

1. Union of Data Across Years and Genders: This step likely involves combining the data from the different CSV files into a single dataset.
2. Standardizing Player Positions: This step involves mapping position abbreviations to full position names.
3. Selecting and Combining Relevant Data: This step likely involves selecting the relevant columns from the dataset.
4. Calculating Role Level Scores: This step involves calculating the role level score for each player based on their position and the specific attributes relevant to that position.
5. Calculating Role Level Percentages: This step involves normalizing the role level scores by dividing by the maximum possible score for each position and multiplying by 100 to get a percentage.

Now, let's start implementing these steps in the `analysis.py` script. I'll start by loading the CSV files into a SQL database. I'll create a SQL database using SQLite and load each CSV file into a separate table in the database. I'll use the `pandas` library's `read_csv` function to read the CSV files and the `to_sql` function to load the data into the SQL database. I'll start with the `players_15.csv` file.

CONTENT: The `workflow.md` file provides a detailed workflow for processing and analyzing the FIFA data. The steps include:

1. Union of Data Across Years and Genders: This step likely involves combining the data from the different CSV files into a single dataset.
2. Standardizing Player Positions: This step involves mapping position abbreviations to full position names.
3. Selecting and Combining Relevant Data: This step likely involves selecting the relevant columns from the dataset.
4. Calculating Role Level Scores: This step involves calculating the role level score for each player based on their position and the specific attributes relevant to that position.
5. Calculating Role Level Percentages: This step involves normalizing the role level scores by dividing by the maximum possible score for each position and multiplying by 100 to get a percentage.

Now, let's start implementing these steps in the `analysis.py` script. I'll start by loading the CSV files into a SQL database. I'll create a SQL database using SQLite and load each CSV file into a separate table in the database. I'll use the `pandas` library's `read_csv` function to read the CSV files and the `to_sql` function to load the data into the SQL database. I'll start with the `players_15.csv` file.
