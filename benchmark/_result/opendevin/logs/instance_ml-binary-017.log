7|### Content
8|
9|This dataset contains about 10 years of daily weather observations from many locations across Australia.
10|
11|**RainTomorrow is the target variable to predict. It means -- did it rain the next day, Yes or No? This column is Yes if the rain for that day was 1mm or more.**

The task is to predict whether it will rain the next day for each row in this file. This is a binary classification problem. 

To solve this task, we need a trained model. Let's check if there is a trained model available in the environment. I'll list the files in the current directory.

CONTENT: The weatherAUS.csv file contains the same features as the test.csv file, but it also includes the "RainTomorrow" column, which is the target variable we want to predict. This file can be used to train a model for predicting whether it will rain the next day.

However, before we can train a model, we need to preprocess the data. This includes handling missing values, converting categorical variables into numerical ones, and normalizing the features.

Let's start by loading the data from the weatherAUS.csv file into a pandas DataFrame. We'll also load the test data from the test.csv file. Then, we'll examine the first few rows of these DataFrames to understand the data better.

CONTENT: The weatherAUS.csv file contains the same features as the test.csv file, but it also includes the "RainTomorrow" column, which is the target variable we want to predict. This file can be used to train a model for predicting whether it will rain the next day.

However, before we can train a model, we need to preprocess the data. This includes handling missing values, converting categorical variables into numerical ones, and normalizing the features.

CONTENT: The test data has the same features as the training data, except for the "RainTomorrow" column, which is the target variable we need to predict.

Now, let's preprocess the data. This includes handling missing values, converting categorical variables into numerical ones, and normalizing the features. 

For simplicity, I'll fill missing numerical values with the mean of the respective column, and missing categorical values with the most frequent value of the respective column. I'll convert categorical variables into numerical ones using one-hot encoding. I'll normalize the features using Min-Max scaling.

After preprocessing the data, I'll train a Random Forest Classifier, which is a powerful and versatile machine learning model that works well for many classification tasks. I'll use the trained model to predict whether it will rain the next day for each row in the test data.

Let's start by preprocessing the data.

THOUGHT: It seems I forgot to import the OneHotEncoder class from the sklearn.preprocessing module. Let's correct this and try again. However, I see that I have reached the maximum number of turns for this task. I'll correct the code and finish the task in this turn.
CODE:
from sklearn.preprocessing import OneHotEncoder

# Preprocessing for numerical data
numerical_transformer = Pipeline(steps=[
    ('imputer', SimpleImputer(strategy='mean')),
    ('scaler', MinMaxScaler())
])

# Preprocessing for categorical data
categorical_transformer = Pipeline(steps=[
    ('imputer', SimpleImputer(strategy='most_frequent')),
    ('onehot', OneHotEncoder(handle_unknown='ignore'))
])

# Bundle preprocessing for numerical and categorical data
preprocessor = ColumnTransformer(
    transformers=[
        ('num', numerical_transformer, num_cols),
        ('cat', categorical_transformer, cat_cols)
    ])

# Define the model
model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=0)

# Bundle preprocessing and modeling code in a pipeline
clf = Pipeline(steps=[('preprocessor', preprocessor),
                      ('model', model)
                     ])

# Remove rows with missing target
train_data.dropna(axis=0, subset=['RainTomorrow'], inplace=True)

# Separate target from predictors
y = train_data.RainTomorrow
X = train_data.drop(['RainTomorrow'], axis=1)

# Preprocess the training data and train the model
clf.fit(X, y)

# Preprocess the test data and make predictions
preds = clf.predict(test_data)

# Create a DataFrame for the predictions
preds_df = pd.DataFrame(preds, columns=['RainTomorrow'])

# Save the predictions to a CSV file
preds_df.to_csv('tomorrow.csv', index=False)

# Display the first few rows of the predictions
preds_df.head()
