Since we are interested in the number of pull requests made by the users "soc" and "xeno-by" for each year between 2011 and 2016, we only need the `pulls.csv` file. 

Let's filter the data for the users "soc" and "xeno-by" and for the years 2011 to 2016. We also need to convert the `date` column to datetime format to extract the year.
CODE:
# Convert the date column to datetime
pulls['date'] = pd.to_datetime(pulls['date'])

# Extract the year from the date
pulls['year'] = pulls['date'].dt.year

# Filter the data for the users "soc" and "xeno-by"
pulls_filtered = pulls[pulls['user'].isin(['soc', 'xeno-by'])]

# Filter the data for the years 2011 to 2016
pulls_filtered = pulls_filtered[pulls_filtered['year'].between(2011, 2016)]

# Count the number of pull requests made by each user for each year
pulls_count = pulls_filtered.groupby(['user', 'year']).size().reset_index(name='count')

THOUGHT: The template file `pull_requests_by_year_and_author.csv` has a column for each year from 2011 to 2016 and a column for each user ("soc" and "xeno-by"). 

Let's fill in the template with the pull request counts we calculated earlier.
CODE:
# Pivot the pulls_count DataFrame to match the format of the template
pulls_pivot = pulls_count.pivot(index='year', columns='user', values='count').reset_index()

# Rename the year column to date to match the template
pulls_pivot.rename(columns={'year': 'date'}, inplace=True)

# Fill NaN values with 0
pulls_pivot.fillna(0, inplace=True)

# Convert the counts to integers
pulls_pivot['soc'] = pulls_pivot['soc'].astype(int)
pulls_pivot['xeno-by'] = pulls_pivot['xeno-by'].astype(int)

# Save the result to the template file
pulls_pivot.to_csv('pull_requests_by_year_and_author.csv', index=False)
