1|## Overview
2|
3|**Welcome to the 2023 Kaggle Playground Series!** Thank you to everyone who participated in and contributed to Season 3 Playground Series so far!** **
4|
5|**Your Goal:** For this Episode of the Series, your task is to use binary classification to predict a patient's smoking status given information about various other health indicators. Good luck!
6|
7|### Evaluation
8|
9|Submissions are evaluated on** **[area under the ROC curve](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_operating_characteristic) between the predicted probability and the observed target.
10|
11|## Submission File
12|
13|For each** **`id` in the test set, you must predict the probability for the target variable** **`smoking`. The file should contain a header and have the following format:
14|
15|```
16|id,smoking
17|159256,0.5
18|159257,0.5
19|159258,0.5
20|etc.

THOUGHT: The test dataset has the same structure as the training dataset, except it does not include the 'smoking' column, which is our target variable to predict.

Now, let's proceed with the data analysis and model building. We'll use a simple logistic regression model for this binary classification task. But before that, we need to check if there are any missing values in the datasets. If there are, we'll need to handle them appropriately. Let's check for missing values in the training and test datasets.

THOUGHT: There are no missing values in the training and test datasets, which is great. Now, let's proceed with the model building. We'll use a logistic regression model for this binary classification task. 

First, we need to separate the features (X) and the target variable (y) in the training dataset. Then, we'll train the logistic regression model on these data. After that, we'll use the trained model to predict the probabilities of the 'smoking' variable for the test dataset. 

Let's start by separating the features and the target variable in the training dataset.
CODE:
# Separate features and target variable in the training dataset
X_train = train_data.drop(['id', 'smoking'], axis=1)
y_train = train_data['smoking']

THOUGHT: The features and target variable have been successfully separated in the training dataset. Now, let's train a logistic regression model on these data. But before that, we need to install the necessary library, scikit-learn.

model.fit(X_train, y_train)

THOUGHT: The logistic regression model has been trained on the training data, although it did not fully converge. This might be due to the scale of the data or the complexity of the model. However, let's proceed with this model for now.

Next, let's use the trained model to predict the probabilities of the 'smoking' variable for the test dataset. But first, we need to prepare the test data in the same way we did for the training data.
CODE:
# Load the test dataset
test_data = pd.read_csv('test.csv')

# Prepare the test data
X_test = test_data.drop('id', axis=1)

# Predict the probabilities of the 'smoking' variable for the test dataset
y_test_pred = model.predict_proba(X_test)[:, 1]

THOUGHT: The model has predicted the probabilities of the 'smoking' variable for the test dataset. Now, let's write these predictions into a CSV file named 'submission.csv' according to the format specified in the README.md file. The file should contain a header and have the following format:

```
id,smoking
159256,0.5
159257,0.5
159258,0.5
etc.
```
Let's create this file.
CODE:
# Create a DataFrame for the submission
submission = pd.DataFrame({
    'id': test_data['id'],
    'smoking': y_test_pred
})

# Write the submission DataFrame to a CSV file
