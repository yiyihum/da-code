5|**Welcome to the 2024 Kaggle Playground Series!** Happy New Year! This is the 1st episode of Season 4. We plan to continue in the spirit of previous playgrounds, providing interesting an approachable datasets for our community to practice their machine learning skills, and anticipate a competition each month.** **
6|
7|**Your Goal:** For this Episode of the Series, your task is to predict whether a customer continues with their account or closes it (e.g., churns). Good luck!

40|## About Dataset
41|
42|The bank customer churn dataset is a commonly used dataset for predicting customer churn in the banking industry. It contains information on bank customers who either left the bank or continue to be a customer. The dataset includes the following attributes:
43|
44|1. Customer ID: A unique identifier for each customer
45|2. Surname: The customer's surname or last name
46|3. Credit Score: A numerical value representing the customer's credit score
47|4. Geography: The country where the customer resides (France, Spain or Germany)
48|5. Gender: The customer's gender (Male or Female)
49|6. Age: The customer's age.
50|7. Tenure: The number of years the customer has been with the bank
51|8. Balance: The customer's account balance

THOUGHT: It seems like the kernel was restarted after installing pandas, and we need to import it again. Let's do that and then load the training data.

# Import pandas

# Load the training data
train_data = pd.read_csv('train.csv')

THOUGHT: The training data is loaded successfully. It contains the same columns as described in the README.md file.

Before we proceed with model training, we need to preprocess the data. This includes handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical variables.

Let's start by checking if there are any missing values in the training data.
CODE:
# Check for missing values
train_data.isnull().sum()

THOUGHT: There are no missing values in the training data, which is good news.

Next, let's handle the categorical variables. The `Geography` and `Gender` columns are categorical. We'll use one-hot encoding to convert these categorical variables into a form that could be provided to a machine learning algorithm.

Also, the `CustomerId`, `Surname`, and `id` columns are not useful for our prediction task, so we'll drop these columns.

Let's perform these preprocessing steps.
CODE:
# Drop the 'CustomerId', 'Surname', and 'id' columns
train_data = train_data.drop(['CustomerId', 'Surname', 'id'], axis=1)

# Perform one-hot encoding on the 'Geography' and 'Gender' columns
train_data = pd.get_dummies(train_data, drop_first=True)

# Display the first few rows of the preprocessed training data
train_data.head()

CONTENT: The training data is now preprocessed and ready for model training. The categorical variables have been one-hot encoded and the unnecessary columns have been dropped.

Next, we'll split the training data into features (X) and the target variable (y), and then we'll train a model. Given that this is a binary classification task and the evaluation metric is the area under the ROC curve, a good choice of model could be a Random Forest Classifier, which is a powerful and versatile machine learning model capable of performing both regression and classification tasks.

Let's import the necessary libraries and train a Random Forest Classifier. If the libraries are not installed, we'll need to install them. Let's check if the necessary libraries are installed.
