We can use the 'order_id' column to join this file with the 'order_items.csv' file. The 'order_date' column can be used to filter the orders placed from 2016 to 2018.

Now, let's write a Python script to perform these operations and write the results into 'result.csv'. We will use the pandas library to read and manipulate the data in the CSV files. If pandas is not installed, we will install it first.

The actual price of each item in an order should be calculated by subtracting the discount from the list price. Let's modify the script to calculate the actual price for each item in an order and then aggregate the total quantity sold and total sales revenue for each bike type from 2016 to 2018.
CODE:
# Importing necessary libraries
import pandas as pd

# Reading the data from the CSV files
products = pd.read_csv('products.csv')
order_items = pd.read_csv('order_items.csv')
orders = pd.read_csv('orders.csv')

# Merging the dataframes
merged_df = pd.merge(order_items, products, on='product_id')
merged_df = pd.merge(merged_df, orders, on='order_id')

# Filtering the data for the years 2016 to 2018
merged_df = merged_df[(merged_df['order_date'] >= '2016-01-01') & (merged_df['order_date'] <= '2018-12-31')]

# Calculating the actual price for each item in an order
merged_df['actual_price'] = merged_df['list_price'] * (1 - merged_df['discount'])

# Calculating the total price for each item in an order
merged_df['total_price'] = merged_df['actual_price'] * merged_df['quantity']

# Calculating the total quantity sold and total sales revenue for each bike type
result = merged_df.groupby('product_name').agg({'quantity': 'sum', 'total_price': 'sum'})

# Writing the results into 'result.csv'
result.to_csv('result.csv')

THOUGHT: It seems there was an error because the 'list_price' column does not exist in the merged dataframe. This could be because the 'list_price' column in the 'order_items.csv' file is not the actual price of each item in an order. The actual price of each item in an order should be calculated by subtracting the discount from the list price. Let's modify the script to calculate the actual price for each item in an order and then aggregate the total quantity sold and total sales revenue for each bike type from 2016 to 2018.
CODE:
# Importing necessary libraries

# Reading the data from the CSV files

order_items = pd.read_csv('order_items.csv')

# Merging the dataframes
merged_df = pd.merge(order_items, products, on='product_id')
merged_df = pd.merge(merged_df, orders, on='order_id')

# Filtering the data for the years 2016 to 2018
merged_df = merged_df[(merged_df['order_date'] >= '2016-01-01') & (merged_df['order_date'] <= '2018-12-31')]

# Calculating the actual price for each item in an order
merged_df['actual_price'] = merged_df['list_price_x'] * (1 - merged_df['discount'])

# Calculating the total price for each item in an order
merged_df['total_price'] = merged_df['actual_price'] * merged_df['quantity']

# Calculating the total quantity sold and total sales revenue for each bike type
result = merged_df.groupby('product_name').agg({'quantity': 'sum', 'total_price': 'sum'})

# Writing the results into 'result.csv'
