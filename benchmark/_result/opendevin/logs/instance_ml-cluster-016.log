CONTENT: The missing values have been removed. Now, let's convert the categorical variables into numerical variables. We will convert the 'Country' column into numerical values using one-hot encoding. We will also drop the 'Invoice', 'StockCode', 'Description', and 'InvoiceDate' columns as they are not relevant for customer segmentation. We will keep 'Quantity', 'Price', and 'Customer ID' as they are.
