Next, let's examine the 'order_items.csv' file, which likely contains information about the sales volume of each product.

Finally, let's examine the 'orders.csv' file, which likely contains information about when each order was made.

THOUGHT: The 'orders.csv' file contains information about each order, including the order ID, customer ID, order status, order date, required date, shipped date, store ID, and staff ID. The order ID can be used to link this data with the 'order_items.csv' file, and the order date can be used to calculate the monthly average sales volume.

Now that we understand the structure of the database and the relationships between the tables, we can proceed to calculate the monthly average sales volume for each bike category. We'll need to join the 'order_items.csv', 'orders.csv', 'products.csv', and 'categories.csv' files, group the data by month and bike category, and calculate the average sales volume.

Let's start by loading the data from these files into pandas DataFrames.

order_items = pd.read_csv('order_items.csv')
orders = pd.read_csv('orders.csv')

THOUGHT: The data has been loaded correctly into pandas DataFrames. Now, let's join these DataFrames to create a single DataFrame that contains all the necessary information. We'll join the 'order_items' DataFrame with the 'orders' DataFrame on the 'order_id' column, the 'products' DataFrame on the 'product_id' column, and the 'categories' DataFrame on the 'category_id' column. After joining, we'll group the data by month and bike category, and calculate the average sales volume.

# Convert the 'order_date' column to datetime
orders['order_date'] = pd.to_datetime(orders['order_date'])
