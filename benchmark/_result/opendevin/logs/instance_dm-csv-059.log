# Customer Analytics and A/B Testing 

The most successful companies today are the ones that know their customers so well that they can anticipate their needs.
Customer analytics and in particular A/B Testing are crucial parts of
leveraging quantitative know-how to help make business decisions that generate value. This course
 covers the ins and outs of how to use Python to
 analyze customer behavior and business trends as well as how to create, run,
 and analyze A/B tests to make proactive, data-driven business decisions.

THOUGHT: The error message indicates that we are trying to subtract a timezone-aware datetime object from a timezone-naive datetime object. The `reg_date` column in the `user_demographics_v1.csv` file is timezone-aware (it includes the 'Z' at the end, which stands for the UTC timezone), while the `date` column in the `purchase_data.csv` file is timezone-naive (it does not include any timezone information).

To fix this, we need to make both datetime objects either timezone-aware or timezone-naive. In this case, it would be easier to make both datetime objects timezone-naive by removing the timezone information from the `reg_date` column.
CODE:
# Remove timezone information from 'reg_date'
user_data['reg_date'] = user_data['reg_date'].dt.tz_localize(None)

# Merge the two dataframes on 'uid' again
