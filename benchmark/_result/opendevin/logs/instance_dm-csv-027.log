## About Dataset

Netflix is a popular streaming service that offers a vast catalog of movies, TV shows, and original contents. This dataset is a cleaned version of the original version which can be found** **[here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/netflix-shows). The data consist of contents added to Netflix from 2008 to 2021. The oldest content is as old as 1925 and the newest as 2021. This dataset will be cleaned with PostgreSQL and visualized with Tableau. The purpose of this dataset is to test my data cleaning and visualization skills. The cleaned data can be found below and the Tableau dashboard can be found** **[here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/abdulrasaq.ariyo/viz/NetflixTVShowsMovies_16615029026580/NetflixDashboard) .** **

## Data Cleaning

We are going to:

1. Treat the Nulls** **
2. Treat the duplicates
3. Populate missing rows
4. Drop unneeded columns
5. Split columns
   Extra steps and more explanation on the process will be explained through the code comments

CONTENT: The DataFrame has been loaded successfully. Now, let's find the top 10 countries by the number of produced shows. We can do this by grouping the data by the 'country' column and counting the number of shows for each country. Then, we sort the counts in descending order and take the first 10. 

After that, we will find the top 10 movie genres by the number of occurrences. The 'listed_in' column contains the genres, but a show can belong to multiple genres, which are separated by commas. We need to split this column into individual genres, then count the occurrences of each genre, sort them in descending order, and take the first 10. 

Let's perform these operations.

CONTENT: The DataFrame has been loaded successfully. Now, let's find the top 10 countries by the number of produced shows. We can do this by grouping the data by the 'country' column and counting the number of shows for each country. Then, we sort the counts in descending order and take the first 10. 

After that, we will find the top 10 movie genres by the number of occurrences. The 'listed_in' column contains the genres, but a show can belong to multiple genres, which are separated by commas. We need to split this column into individual genres, then count the occurrences of each genre, sort them in descending order, and take the first 10.
