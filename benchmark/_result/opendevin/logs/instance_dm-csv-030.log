1|# The-GitHub-History-of-the-Scala-Language
2|Project Description
3|---
4|Open source projects contain entire development histories - who made changes, the changes themselves, 
5|and code reviews. In this project, will be challenged to read in, clean up, and visualize the real-world 
6|project repository of Scala that spans data from a version control system (Git) as well as a project hosting 
7|site (GitHub). With almost 30,000 commits and a history spanning over ten years, Scala is a mature language. 
8|Will find out who has had the most influence on its development and who are the experts.
9|
10|The dataset includes the project history of Scala retrieved from Git and GitHub as a set of CSV files.

CONTENT: The `pull_files.csv` file contains two columns: `pid` (pull request id) and `file` (the file involved in the pull request). 

The task requires us to identify the latest 10 pull requests, merge the related file data, and find the unique files involved in these pull requests. 

Let's start by loading the data from `pulls.csv` and `pull_files.csv` into pandas dataframes. Then, we'll sort the pull requests by date, select the latest 10, and merge the related file data. Finally, we'll find the unique files involved in these pull requests.
