1|# Customer Segmentation
2|
3|The most successful companies today are the ones that know their customers so well that they can anticipate their needs. Data analysts play a key role in unlocking these in-depth insights, and segmenting the customers to better serve them. In this course, you will learn real-world techniques on customer segmentation and behavioral analytics, using a real dataset containing anonymized customer transactions from an online retailer. You will first run cohort analysis to understand customer trends. You will then learn how to build easy to interpret customer segments. On top of that, you will prepare the segments you created, making them ready for machine learning. Finally, you will make your segments more powerful with k-means clustering, in just few lines of code! By the end of this course, you will be able to apply practical customer behavioral analytics and segmentation techniques.

1|#### Definations
2|
3|* snapshot date: 2011-12-10 00:00:00
4|
5|* Recency (R): Measures how many days have passed since the customer's most recent transaction relative to the snapshot date.
6|
7|* Frequency (F): Counts how many times a customer has made a purchase within the time frame being analyzed. This is often done by counting the number of invoices (as each invoice is typically associated with a purchase).
8|
9|* Monetary Value (M): Reflects the total amount of money a customer has spent during the time frame being analyzed, which you obtain by summing up all of a customer's transactions.
10|
11|#### Possible steps
12|Sort customers into groups based on how recently they bought something, how often they buy, and how much money they spend. Think of it like giving grades to customers to see who are the best and who might need more attention. Use 1~4 to present different groups.
13|1. You should group the customers into three separate groups based on Recency, and Frequency, assign these labels to four equal percentile groups.
14|2. Assign customers to four groups based on the MonetaryValue percentiles and then calculate an RFM_Score which is a sum of the R, F, and M values.
15|3. If the RFM score is greater than or equal to 10, the level should be "Top". If it's between 6 and 10 it should be "Middle", and otherwise it should be "Low".

CONTENT: The online12M.csv file contains the following columns:

- InvoiceNo: The number assigned to each transaction
- StockCode: The code of the item

- Quantity: The quantity of the item purchased
- InvoiceDate: The date of the purchase
- UnitPrice: The price of the item
- CustomerID: The ID of the customer
- Country: The country of the customer

Now, let's load this data into a pandas DataFrame to start the analysis. We'll calculate the Recency, Frequency, and Monetary value for each customer. Then, we'll segment the customers into groups based on these values and write the results into a new CSV file.

CONTENT: The error message indicates that the number of bin labels must be one fewer than the number of bin edges. This is because the 'duplicates' argument is set to 'drop', which can reduce the number of bins, but the number of labels remains the same.

To solve this, we can use the pd.cut() function instead of pd.qcut(). The pd.cut() function will create equal-width bins, which ensures that the number of bin edges will match the number of labels. Let's modify the code and try again.
