3|The first** **[automated essay scoring competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/asap-aes/overview) to tackle automated grading of student-written essays was twelve years ago. How far have we come from this initial competition? With an updated dataset and light years of new ideas we hope to see if we can get to the latest in automated grading to provide a real impact to overtaxed teachers who continue to have challenges with providing timely feedback, especially in underserved communities.** **

5|The goal of this competition is to train a model to score student essays. Your efforts are needed to reduce the high expense and time required to hand grade these essays. Reliable automated techniques could allow essays to be introduced in testing, a key indicator of student learning that is currently commonly avoided due to the challenges in grading.

23|Essay writing is an important method to evaluate student learning and performance. It is also time-consuming for educators to grade by hand. Automated Writing Evaluation (AWE) systems can score essays to supplement an educator’s other efforts. AWEs also allow students to receive regular and timely feedback on their writing. However, due to their costs, many advancements in the field are not widely available to students and educators. Open-source solutions to assess student writing are needed to reach every community with these important educational tools.
24|Previous efforts to develop open-source AWEs have been limited by small datasets that were not nationally diverse or focused on common essay formats. The first Automated Essay Scoring competition scored student-written short-answer responses, however, this is a writing task not often used in the classroom. To improve upon earlier efforts, a more expansive dataset that includes high-quality, realistic classroom writing samples was required. Further, to broaden the impact, the dataset should include samples across economic and location populations to mitigate the potential of algorithmic bias.
25|In this competition, you will work with the largest open-access writing dataset aligned to current standards for student-appropriate assessments. Can you help produce an open-source essay scoring algorithm that improves upon the original** **[Automated Student Assessment Prize (ASAP)](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/asap-aes/overview) competition hosted in 2012?** **
26|Competition host Vanderbilt University is a private research university in Nashville, Tennessee. For this competition, Vanderbilt has partnered with The Learning Agency Lab, an Arizona-based independent nonprofit focused on developing the science of learning-based tools and programs for the social good.
27|To ensure the results of this competition are widely available, winning solutions will be released as open source. More robust and accessible AWE options will help more students get the frequent feedback they need and provide educators with additional support, especially in underserved districts.

37|Submissions are scored based on the quadratic weighted kappa, which measures the agreement between two outcomes. This metric typically varies from 0 (random agreement) to 1 (complete agreement). In the event that there is less agreement than expected by chance, the metric may go below 0.
38|
39|The quadratic weighted kappa is calculated as follows. First, an N x N histogram matrix** ***O* is constructed, such that** ***O~i,j~* corresponds to the number of** **`essay_id`s** ***i* (actual) that received a predicted value** ** *j* . An** ***N-by-N** ***matrix of weights,** ** *w* , is calculated based on the difference between actual and predicted values:
40|
41|**𝑤**𝑖**,**𝑗**=**(**𝑖**−**𝑗**)**2**(**𝑁**−**1**)**2**
42|
43|An** ***N-by-N* histogram matrix of expected outcomes,** ** *E* , is calculated assuming that there is no correlation between values. ** **
44|This is calculated as the outer product between the actual histogram vector of outcomes and the predicted histogram vector, normalized such that** ***E* and** ***O* have the same sum.
45|
46|From these three matrices, the quadratic weighted kappa is calculated as:
47|
48|**𝜅**=**1**−**∑**𝑖**,**𝑗**𝑤**𝑖**,**𝑗**𝑂**𝑖**,**𝑗**∑**𝑖**,**𝑗**𝑤**𝑖**,**𝑗**𝐸**𝑖**,**𝑗**.**

2|c92e704,"The automobile was made a long time ago to help us move around faster and more efficient,however,have we really thought about the benefits that could come from limiting the usuage of cars such as:Saving money in gas and insurance,Less car crash related injuries and even because its better for the enviroment.
3|
4|With limiting the usuage of cars comes many pro's such as saving money. On average,an American spends about thirty-five to fourty dollars on gas per fill-up and one hundred to two hundred dollars a month on insurance a month depending on age,experience,accidents,etc. By limiting your car usage comletely or even just a little just imagine the extra money you'll have aying around for the nessecities and maybe even a ittle you-time. Say you buy a bike and the only time you use your car is to drive to work and anywhere out-of-state,that means that you'll be able to go a week with roughly two gallons of gas. That puts you at about thirty-eight hundred dollars a year where if you were purchasing four or five gallons a week you'd be spending approximately eleven thousand dollars a year. Thats no chump change. You're insurance would gradually decrease due to safe driving and age so along with gas being cheaper,so would the insurance.

6|Florida is a state well-known for car crashes due to weather conditions like rain and fog and you can't do anything to change that other than take a different,much safer mode of transportaion such as a bus. Nowadays bus and semi-truck drivers are more experienced and cautius then they used to for one reason,CYB(Cover your Butt).You see major bus and semi-truck companies now that due to the size of their vehicles,if there's ever crash involving one of their autmobiles then they're likely to get blamed cause of the size of the vehicles and so it would make since for them to send their drivers to extensive training and make sure that their trucks are in good hands,which is exactly what they do. Studies show that you're chances of being in a wreck in a bus are one of every one hundred rides while being in a car driven by yourself puts you at a whopping one of ten ridesyur chances of safety are greatly increased.
7|
8|The United States of America has no shortage of pollution and that's not helped by the fact that we have one of the largest populations of personal automobiles inhabiting this country. There are many other kinds of pollution that occurrs in the land of the free but most of it like factory smoke,large ship(boat)smoke and even resturant made smoke can not really be stopped or diminished by you or me but one form of pollution we can prevent is automobile smoke. In the US up to fifty percent of greenhouse gas is from cars(certain areas).If you stop using you car and ride a bike even thugh it won't seem like muchyou'd be suprised at the difference. Say a sall cmmunity around yur neighborhood gives up their cars that could account for half a percent of greenhouse gas which is more than it seems. Just ask yourself if you want your friends and family growing up in a dying,polluted world.
9|
10|In conclusion,I'm not discrediting the huge help cars can be in our daily lives I'm just saying if we continue along this car-orientated path,pollution may be what ends our daily lives.    ",4
11|a2b772a,"You think the face on Mars was formed by aliens? I could see why. Conspiracy theorists are everywhere. I am here to explain to you why you are wrong. You see, I have some very valuable information. If you have ever seen the ""Middle Buttle"", in the Snake River plain of Idaho, you would really see the resemblance towards the face of the moon and the Buttle. Though, this could just be coincidence.
12|
13|For all of you out there who think that NASA is trying to hide information from you, if that was the case, you would not know about the face of mars. If we did in fact know if the face was crated by other life forms, aka ""aliens"", NASA would be blabbing it's mouth about it everywhere. That would make NASA'S popularity grow and be better for them all around, so why hide something that will help us?
14|
15|This supposed face has brought along alot of good things, such as, starring in Hollywood films, appearing in books and magazines, and even being discussed on talk shows. With every good thing there is bad things, unfortuately. There are people saying NASA is hiding information and making up other wild conspiracy theories.
16|
17|Though, this does not make sense considering when we first spotted the image of the face in 1976, we sexposed it to the world. I do not understand how that is hiding anything. Over the years, NASA has tried getting Viking 1 to get better images of the face, and succeeding. Viking 1 got better images in 1998 and 2001. The face is extermely hard to find, located on Cyndonia, you can only find it some days. Now when NASA spends so much time trying to get better images for the people, that sorta rings a bell, maybe saying there is no hdden information.
18|
19|Now, like I said in the beginning, any information or evidence at all would definetly help NASA, so why hide it? ",3
20|f2f350b,"Citizens cars are good to have but all the fines and stress they are putting on us makes us not wont to buy a car. But now i see we need to have a change and just start walking and finding another way other then our cars because they are talking about fining and impounding our cars the ones (Cars) we paid full cash for.
21|
22|To start off with, accroding to the article in ''Life Goes On Without Cars'', u could park at a garage but its gotta be ownship and u would have to buy space that cost $40,000, along with a home. For example, u would have to buy a house pay for that rent and also pay for the parking fee that u brought with the house. So with that being said u should just buy a house, and not own a car and just walk, ride a bike ,or take a bus to where every u got to go.
23|
24|Secondly, now there saying in article ''Driving due to smog'' On Monday motorists with-numbered licence plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine($31).The same would apply to odd-numbered plated the following the day. That's not right because you brought your  car, but you could only drive it a certain day (would ever the law says). The understanding that I'm getting is you got to follow the law rules when ever that applies to the goverment people, which is understandable. But my point is I brought my car and i should be able to drive my car when ever I feel like it.
25|
26|Futher more, Now they  want to have a ''Car Free Day'' In the article Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota, they say millions of Colombins hiked, biked, skated, or took buses to work during a car-free yesterday, leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams. For example, If the people did drive on a car-free day they would face $25 fine. So if it rained and u needed to get somewhere you could't drive u would have to take a bus, walk, train, or skate. Or you would be fined.
27|
28|In Closing, from the understanding that I'm getting,  I advise everyone to take the bus,walk,skate,bike,or hike just to get to where you got to be also you could just not own a car. Because either way, if u break the rules you are going to be to be fine or  they could impounded your car and thats would be a lot of mess  becasue you paid for a car but u gotta pay the fine and pay to get your car out the impounded. So EVERYONE just walk,bike,hike,skate,or take a train or bus.    ",3
29|7648ff4,"The author supports his ideas well in ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus."" The author supports his ideas in many ways that make going to Venus seem not impossible, only difficult. Their claim that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers is supported by many logical reasons. The author supports his idea that Venus is a worthy pursuit by giving backround on the planet, saying why it is not impossible, and because overcoming the challenge would bring knowledge and more exploration.
30|
31|First, the author makes Venus travel worthy by talking about the background of the planet. In paragraph 2 they make the planet seem worthwhile to explore, ""Often referred to as Earth's 'twin,' Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size and occasionally the closest in distance too."" Just because Venus is similar to earth why does that make it enticing to explore? Since Venus is similar to earth it means that we can learn many things from the planet and maybe make it inhabitable some day.
32|
33|Additionally, the text makes Venus seem worthy of pursuit despite the dangers by talking about how simple it would be to overcome the dangers that the hostile planet holds. The author provides an example from NASA that eradicates the danger of the planet in paragraph 5 when they say, "" Imagine a blimp-like vehile hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusian landscape. Just as our jet airplanes travel at a higher altitude to fly over many storms, a vehicle hovering over Venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up and out of their way."" With this vehicle studying Venus would no longer be dangerous and it becomes more possible to explore our twin than impossible.
34|
35|Moreover, being able to study Venus would not only bring knowledge about the planet, but would also lead to more expeditions. In paragraph 8 the author describes the benefits of studying Venus when they say, ""Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors."" The author is saying that knowledge is not the only thing that is gained from going to Venus, but we will also be able to study much more. Being able to explore Venus means that we can study other environments that are dangerous for humans like the deep ocean or other hostile planets.
36|
37|Overall, the author makes the pursuit of Venus enticing in many brilliant ways. They talk about what makes Venus more important to study than other planets. The author eliminates the danger presented when studying the dangerous planet. Exploring Venus is said to provide benefits that could help future generations with their studies. Despite the dangers Venus is a planet that is worth studying.",4
38|b4322b4,"The author suggests that studying Venus is a worhty pursuit despite the dangers it presents because Venus has a lot of similarities and differences with Earth. Venus is very hot, the atmospheric pressure is very high. That is why studying Venus will be such a hard task. But it also has a lot in common with the Earth. Venus is close in size and is the closest planet to Earth.
39|
40|The author says that studying Venus will be a difficult task because Venus and a lot of similarities and differences than the Earth. The average temperature on Venus is over 800 degrees Fahrenheit. Your book will burn up because it is too hot and Venus will melt any phone or tablet as well. In the article it says ""Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system"". Venus also has a thick atmosphere of 97% carbon dioxide that surrounds Venus. Which makes it even more challenging because of its clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere. Another reason why it is such a hard task to get to Venus is because the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we usually experience on Earth. In the article it says ""Such an enviroment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our oceans and would liquefy many metals"". This means that we have never experience any atmospheric pressure that high ever. Venusian geology and weather present has erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes and more frequent lightning strikes than Earth.
41|
42|Venus is one of NASA's hardest task to try to make it to there. Venus has such a crazy high temperature and a very high atmospheric pressure. Venus has a highly corrosive sulfuric acid in that surrounds it. There are many more reasons why it is so hard for us to try to study Venus. But so far no one neither a spaceship has touched Venus yet for three decades and only time will tell when we will be able to make it to Venus.",3
43|fb73e38,"I don't think we need driverless cars. It just makes humans even more lazy and is probably a waste on resoureces as well as time. My position on driverless cars are they are not needed just the fact that no one needs to have it. In paragraph seven it states, ""The car can handle functions at speeds up to twenty-five mph, but special touch sensors make sure that driver keeps hold of the wheel. This statement basically states that the car can only go up to twenty-five mph, but you have to be holding the wheel for it to do this. so your basically just sitting there as it just goes the only thing your not working is the gas. You would have to watch just because if you were have to work between work zones or accidents.
44|
45|The most important thing for a driver in a car is safely. This car is pose to help that part out by using cameras to watch the driver and the road. If they were to defunction or break how would you get another one or would you be able to buy them in the store or pay for them again from the company. Also if the technology or the car were to fail while the driver is distracted or worst and someone were to get injuried, who is held in charge for it. Will the driver face the charge or the manufactures who made it?
46|
47|Not to mention it doing all of this stuff at once, how much gas can go for one mile. We are trying to build cars that can go farther and not have that much gas, so what will be the milage on this car that can drive itself. Will it run off of batteries, fossil fuels or something that doesn't harm the environment.
48|
49|This ends my position on driverless cars on the road. I think it's not a good idea based off the fact that we came this far driving cars without them driving for us or anything like it. We can go without cars driving themsevles, what we need to focus on is can we improve how far a car goes with just one gallon of gas so improving their mph. This would help people go farther without the cost of gas it would slow down the rate of resources going down and help our environment. ",3
50|6dc2f1b,"In the article,""Driverless Cars Are Coming"", the author mentioned many benefits about the invention. Things like self-steering, self-accelarating, and self-braking seems intriguing. However, those benefits will not solve the multiple downfalls that the inventions will cause. The cars have not had enough trial or statisitic to prove that they bring mostly positive outcomes rather than negatives, it really is not driverless if it still nees assisting, and it will create multiple changes in our society. New technology have always excite people, but are driverless car really worth the hype?

We use the car to go every where rather it's to the grocery store , work or just to go hang out with friends and family! Just traveling in general. Well imagine if we limited the usage of cars in our community! I strongly believe that doing this would have many advantages to our community for many reasons like it will make people less stressful all the time, there would be less accidents and it would definitly be better for the environment.

4|OMG I ran out of gas or OH my i have to take my car to the shop to get it fixed is usually the two main things you hear people stay when the word ""car"" comes up. Having a car comes with alot of stress because it of expenses and having to take of its every need and usually when someone is stressed they are not the best person you wanna have a conversation with. I think that if we limit the usage of cars a lot of people in the community will be alot happier. According to the article

10|Elisabeth Rosenthal in source 2 a lady name Heidrun Walter says "" When i had a car i was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" and i think that is a perfect example of limited car usauage can make a person happier.
11|
12|In addition, I feel that if that if we limit the car usage in our community it will make this community a much safer environment. We hear and see about many car accidents in our country and community and cars can be very very dangerous. People often get injuried and/or die in car recks to. So limitting the car usage in the communitry will keep people more safe and most importantly alive . Kids will be able to run aroumd the neighborhood and play with their friends and also cross the street safely without the disruption of a car coming and stopping them from what they are doing  because they do not wants to get hurt from the car coming because they do not know who is driving the car.
13|
14|Last but not least limiting the use of car usage in the community because it would definitly be better for the environment. In science class we often talk about how cars polute the air and just mess up the waehter in the car and me my self i can also feel the car changing the more i see cars more cars in the streets. I think that it makes the days hotter and i also think that it makes the winters come around earlier and it makes it alot more colder. I live in the Sunshine florida and in the south. So all year round its usually hot extremly hot but has i realize more people are driving around the winers seem ALOT more cold then it usually is and the cold last for longer periods of time.
15|
16|In conclusion, I belive that if we limit the car usuage in our community it will make it a better place for many reasons. Like it will make people less stressful and  be happier, there will be less accidents on the road and it will also help the environment a lot.                        "
17|44e88b0,"Imagine being a top scientist at NASA and Viking 1 spacecraft ""spotted the shadowy likeness of a human face."" A lot of people thought of alien life possibility, but others thought it to be just a natural landform. What would your thoughts be about the image? The face of Mars is a natural landform. There's similar landforms on Earth, high pixel photos taken, and not enough reliable information to support the alien life theory.
18|
19|To begin, there are similar landforms on Earth to the one on Mars. As stated in the text, ""what the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa- landforms common around the American West."" Also stated in the text is Garvin giving his opinion, ""it reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho.""
20|
21|Another issue with the alien life theory is the fact that NASA has high quality cameras. Quoting the text, ""each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo."" In the result of having high quality pictures you could see small details clearly. As stated in the article Garvin said, "" 'so, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!' "" Concluding that statement nothing other than the landform that had resembled a face was seen on Mars.
22|
23|Finally, there wasn't enough evidence to support the claim of alien life on Mars. The first pictures were blurry and had haze or cloud coverage. This theory was more popular on the online world than in the science world. As stated in the text, ""the 'Face on Mars' has since become a pop icon. It has starred in a Hollywood film, appeared in books, magazines, radio talk shows-even haunted grocery store checkout lines for 25 years!"" This proves that this might be just for publicity and attention. There has been many conspiracy theorists.
24|
25|Ultimately, the face on Mars is just a natural landform. There's similar landforms on Earth, high pixel photos taken, and not enough reliable information to support the alien life theory.       "
26|0ba78ec,"The face of Mars could not be created by aliens. It is a land form created by the conditions of mars and looks like a face only by coincidence. Mesa's are common in this area of Mars and there are many others like this one just without the same shadows which makes the appearance of a human's face.
27|
28|Out of so many different land forms in Cydonia why should this be any different. In the second paragrapgh of the article, it stated that the Cydonia region is known for its buttes and mesas. The face of Mars is just another mesa no different that any other one except for its unique shadows. It is strange to see a formation on an supposedly uninhabited planet that depicts a ""human"" face. Espescially when no human has ever set foot on the planet of Mars before. But at the same time, that is all the more reason to believe that this is nothing more that a weird coincidence since no person has ever been there.
29|
30|To conspiracy theorists dismay, this strange landform is nothing more than martian butte or mesa and a weird coincidence. It is an interesting formation that stumped and puzzled scientests all over the world. But we now know the formation is not anything that will reveal alien lifeforms or alien activity.        "
31|f96c287,"Many people belive that the face on Mars was created by an alien or aliens. We have evidance that proves it was not.
32|
33|In 1997 (MGS) arrived on the Red Planet and stayed there for eighteen long yeas. On April 5,1998 (MGS) got a picture of Cydonia, while thousands of web surfers were waiting for the picture to apper on the JPL web site. The picture reavealed a natural landform. Also that there was no alien moniment after all.
34|
35|Nevertheless, on April 8, 2001a cloudless summer day in CydoniaMars Global Surveyor drew close enough for a second look. We had to roll the spacecraft 25 degrees to center the Face in the field of view, said Garvin. Malins team captured an extraordinary photo using the cameras absolute maximum resolution. Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo.
36|
37|As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size, I added. So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!
38|
39|What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesalandforms common around the American West. These are some facts on how we know that Cydonia the face on Mars was not created by aliens, and is just a normal land structure."
40|317173f,"Driverless Cars are coming soon or later? People have argued that there are positive and negative things about this crazy invention. I see alot of negative things about this invention that is suppose to come into the world by technology. If the car would fail at a point
41|
42|you could be injured, injured bad or death can occur, people have less experince driving and people will be more lazy then what they already are, and someone could even fall asleep because they arent incontrol of the car the car is incontrol of you and something bad could happen if your in danger and the car doesnt alert you like its suppose to or what if it doesnt?
43|
44|What if the car fails at letting you know you are in danger and something bad happens is it your fault or the cars fault? If the car fails at telling you this you could be hurt, hurt badly or you could put your life at risk and you could die if your in seroius trouble. You cant depend on nobody or nothing but yourself. I feel like this could put your life at risk. Most people would like to drive the car not the car drive them. Technology could break down at any time you just never know when that time is. It may not work at its best like they say it will, at some point and time it will or could fail
45|
46|People would have less experince as drivers do today and people would be more lazy. What if your in danger and your incontrol of the car now what if that person has lack of experince and they wont know what to do. They will be in danger and could really hurt themselfs or others. They could crash into another car or crash into smething. This invention is sounding very dangerous not just too me but many others. People are already lazy enough and they would be even more lazy with this invention. Technology is taking control over our world and this would be a big one. Some car accidents are going to happen in the world but i feel like most people are alert and focus already on the road and their surroundings.
47|
48|If you arent incontrol of the car you could possibly fall asleep at the wheel and what if you need to take over? Then what? Something serious could happen and you could put you and others at risk. Most people want to be incontrol of the car and not have the car be incontrol of them. This invention is very dangerous and i dont feel like it would help our world today. If this invention isnt made i feel it will cause no stress and not alot of worries about the negativities that could happen.
49|
50|Technology is taking over our lifes very quickly and thats not how it should be. I hope this dangerous invention doesnt come soon or later in our lifes we need to be resposible of being incontrol of the car at all times. This could cause lack of responsibility in many of peoples lifes. This invention is very dangerous. I hope many others see alot of negatives i see in this invention that might happen in the world I would like to see and many other would like to see more people come together and argue that this is dangerous and shouldnt happen in our world. We shouldnt want to be control by technology. Bad things could happen to you, mine, and others lifes.       "

THOUGHT: The test data is loaded successfully. It contains the 'essay_id' and 'full_text' columns. 

Now, let's proceed with the task. We need to train a model using the training data and then use the model to predict the scores for the essays in the test data. 

Given the nature of the task (predicting a score based on text data), a good approach would be to use a machine learning model that can handle text data, such as a Natural Language Processing (NLP) model. 

However, before we can train a model, we need to preprocess the text data. This typically involves steps such as tokenization (breaking the text into individual words), removing stop words (common words like 'and', 'the', 'a', which don't carry much information), and vectorization (converting the words into numerical vectors that can be used as input to a machine learning model).

Let's start by installing the necessary libraries for text preprocessing and model training. We'll need the nltk library for text preprocessing and the sklearn library for model training.

THOUGHT: The essays in the training data have been tokenized successfully. The 'tokens' column contains the tokenized essays.

The next step in text preprocessing is to remove stop words. Stop words are common words like 'and', 'the', 'a', which don't carry much information. Let's remove the stop words from the tokenized essays.
CODE:
from nltk.corpus import stopwords

# Download the stop words
nltk.download('stopwords')

# Get the English stop words
stop_words = set(stopwords.words('english'))

# Remove the stop words
train_data['tokens'] = train_data['tokens'].apply(lambda tokens: [token for token in tokens if token not in stop_words])

# Display the first few rows of the DataFrame
train_data.head()

THOUGHT: The stop words have been removed from the tokenized essays. The 'tokens' column now contains the tokenized essays without the stop words.

The final step in text preprocessing is vectorization. This involves converting the words into numerical vectors that can be used as input to a machine learning model. We'll use the TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) method for vectorization. This method takes into account not just the frequency of a word in a single document (or essay in this case), but also in the entire corpus of documents.

Let's vectorize the tokenized essays.
CODE:
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer

# Initialize a TfidfVectorizer
vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer()

# Vectorize the tokenized essays
X_train = vectorizer.fit_transform(train_data['tokens'].apply(' '.join))

# Get the scores
y_train = train_data['score']

# Display the shape of the vectors
X_train.shape, y_train.shape

THOUGHT: The tokenized essays have been vectorized successfully. The vectors are stored in X_train, and the scores are stored in y_train. The shape of X_train indicates that we have 14710 essays, each represented as a vector of 58820 features.

Now, let's train a model using this data. Given the nature of the task (predicting a score based on text data), a good approach would be to use a regression model. Let's use a simple linear regression model for this task.
CODE:
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

# Initialize a LinearRegression model
model = LinearRegression()

# Train the model
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

THOUGHT: The model has been trained successfully. Now, let's use the trained model to predict the scores for the essays in the test data.

But before we can do that, we need to preprocess the test data in the same way we preprocessed the training data. This involves tokenizing the essays, removing stop words, and vectorizing the tokenized essays.
CODE:
# Tokenize the essays
test_data['tokens'] = test_data['full_text'].apply(word_tokenize)

# Remove the stop words
test_data['tokens'] = test_data['tokens'].apply(lambda tokens: [token for token in tokens if token not in stop_words])

# Vectorize the tokenized essays
X_test = vectorizer.transform(test_data['tokens'].apply(' '.join))

# Predict the scores
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Display the first few predicted scores
y_pred[:5]

THOUGHT: The scores for the essays in the test data have been predicted successfully. The predicted scores are continuous values, but the actual scores are integers. So, let's round the predicted scores to the nearest integer.
CODE:
import numpy as np

# Round the predicted scores to the nearest integer
y_pred = np.round(y_pred).astype(int)

# Display the first few rounded predicted scores
y_pred[:5]

THOUGHT: The predicted scores have been rounded to the nearest integer successfully.

Now, let's create a submission file named submission.csv in the format specified by sample_submission.csv. This file should contain two columns: 'essay_id' and 'score'. The 'essay_id' column should contain the essay IDs from the test data, and the 'score' column should contain the predicted scores.
CODE:
# Create a DataFrame for the submission data
submission_data = pd.DataFrame({
    'essay_id': test_data['essay_id'],
    'score': y_pred
})

# Write the submission data to a CSV file
submission_data.to_csv('submission.csv', index=False)

# Display the first few rows of the submission DataFrame
submission_data.head()
