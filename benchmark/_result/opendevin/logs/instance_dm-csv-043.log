1|# Customer Segmentation
2|
3|The most successful companies today are the ones that know their customers so well that they can anticipate their needs. Data analysts play a key role in unlocking these in-depth insights, and segmenting the customers to better serve them. In this course, you will learn real-world techniques on customer segmentation and behavioral analytics, using a real dataset containing anonymized customer transactions from an online retailer. You will first run cohort analysis to understand customer trends. You will then learn how to build easy to interpret customer segments. On top of that, you will prepare the segments you created, making them ready for machine learning. Finally, you will make your segments more powerful with k-means clustering, in just few lines of code! By the end of this course, you will be able to apply practical customer behavioral analytics and segmentation techniques.

THOUGHT: The README.md file provides a general overview of the dataset, which contains anonymized customer transactions from an online retailer. The goal is to perform customer segmentation and behavioral analytics.

Next, let's check the content of the tips.txt file to understand the specific instructions for calculating the retention data for each cohort.

3|* Each column represents the CohortIndex, which is the number of months since the first transaction.

# Convert the InvoiceDate column to datetime
df['InvoiceDate'] = pd.to_datetime(df['InvoiceDate'])

# Extract the month of the first purchase for each customer
df['CohortMonth'] = df.groupby('CustomerID')['InvoiceDate'].transform('min').dt.to_period('M')

# Calculate the number of months since the first transaction for each row
df['CohortIndex'] = (df['InvoiceDate'].dt.to_period('M') - df['CohortMonth']).apply(lambda x: x.n + 1)

# Calculate the retention rate for each cohort
retention = df.groupby(['CohortMonth', 'CohortIndex']).size().unstack(1)

# Calculate the size of the original cohort
cohort_sizes = retention.iloc[:, 0]

# Divide the count of active customers in each subsequent month by the size of the original cohort
retention = retention.divide(cohort_sizes, axis=0)

CONTENT: The `retention.csv` file contains the retention data for each cohort as expected. Each row represents a cohort defined by the month of the first purchase. Each column represents the CohortIndex, which is the number of months since the first transaction. The cells contain the retention rate, which is the proportion of the original cohort that made purchases in the subsequent months.

So, the final answer to the question is <solution>retention.csv</solution>.
