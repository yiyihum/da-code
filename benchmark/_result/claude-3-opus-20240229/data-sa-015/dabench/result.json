  "system_message": "# CONTEXT #\nYou are a data scientist proficient in analyzing data. You excel at using Bash commands and Python code to solve data-related problems. You are working in a Bash environment with all necessary Python libraries installed. If you need to install additional libraries, you can use the 'pip install' command. You are starting in the /workspace directory, which contains all the data needed for your tasks. You can only use the actions provided in the ACTION SPACE to solve the task. The maximum number of steps you can take is 20.\n\n# ACTION SPACE #\n\n## Bash Action\n* Signature: Bash(code=\"shell_command\")\n* Description: This action string will execute a valid shell command in the `code` field. Only non-interactive commands are supported. Commands like \"vim\" and viewing images directly (e.g., using \"display\") are not allowed.\n* Example: Bash(code=\"ls -l\")\n\n## Python Action\n* Signature: Python(file_path=\"path/to/python_file\"):\n```python\nexecutable_python_code\n```\n* Description: This action will create a python file in the field `file_path` with the content wrapped by paired ``` symbols. If the file already exists, it will be overwritten. After creating the file, the python file will be executed. \n* Example: Python(file_path=\"./hello_world.py\"):\n```python\nprint(\"Hello, world!\")\n```\n\n## SQL Action\n* Signature: SQL(file_path=\"path/to/database_file\", command=\"sql_command\", output=\"path/to/output_file.csv\" or \"direct\")\n* Description: Executes an SQL command on the specified database file. If `output` is set to a file path, the results are saved to this CSV file; if set to 'direct', results are displayed directly.\n* Constraints:\n  - The database file must be accessible and in a format compatible with SQLite (e.g., .sqlite, .db).\n  - SQL commands must be valid and safely formatted to prevent security issues such as SQL injection.\n* Examples:\n  - Example1: SQL(file_path=\"data.sqlite\", command=\"SELECT name FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='table'\", output=\"directly\")\n  - Example2: SQL(file_path=\"data.db\", command=\"SELECT * FROM users\", output=\"users_output.csv\")\n\n## Terminate Action\n* Signature: Terminate(output=\"literal_answer_or_output_path\")\n* Description: This action denotes the completion of the entire task and returns the final answer or the output file/folder path. Make sure the output file is located in the initial workspace directory.\n* Examples:\n  - Example1: Terminate(output=\"New York\")\n  - Example2: Terminate(output=\"result.csv\")\n  - Example3: Terminate(output=\"FAIL\")\n\n\n# NOTICE #\n1. You need to fully understand the action space and its arguments before using it.\n2. You should first understand the environment and conduct data analysis on the given data before handling the task.\n3. You can't take some problems for granted. For example, you should check the existence of files before reading them.\n4. If the function execution fails, you should analyze the error and try to solve it.\n5. For challenging tasks like ML, you may need to verify the correctness of the method by checking the accuracy or other metrics, and try to optimize the method.\n6. Before finishing the task, ensure all instructions are met and verify the existence and correctness of any generated files.\n\n# RESPONSE FROMAT # \nFor each task input, your response should contain:\n1. One analysis of the task and the current environment, reasoning to determine the next action (prefix \"Thought: \").\n2.

We use SymPy to obtain the coefficients, and subsequently write the coefficients and the fitted normal distribution values to a CSV file.\r\n\r\nHere are the parameters for our analysis:\r\n\r\n- start_degree = 10\r\n- end_degree = 30\r\n- step = 5\r\n\r\nHere's a brief explanation of the columns in the CSV file:\r\n\r\n- **Degree**: The degree of each term in the polynomial.\r\n- **Coefficient**: The coefficient of the polynomial for the corresponding degree.\r\n- **Fitted_Normal_PDF**: The value of the normal distribution's PDF at the corresponding degree, fitted to match the distribution of the polynomial coefficients.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Introduction to `polynomial_values.csv`\r\n\r\nThe `polynomial_values.csv` file contains the evaluated values of a specific polynomial of the form:\r\n\r\n\\[ P(t) = \\prod_{i=1}^{m} (1 + t^{2i + 1}) \\]\r\n\r\nFor this file, the polynomial was generated with \\( m = 5 \\), resulting in the product:\r\n\r\n\\[ P(t) = (1 + t^3)(1 + t^5)(1 + t^7)(1 + t^9)(1 + t^{11}) \\]\r\n\r\nThe file provides the polynomial values evaluated at 100 equally spaced points within the range of \\(-10\\) to \\(10\\). This data helps to visualize and analyze the behavior of the polynomial over a specified range of \\( t \\) values.\r\n\r\n### Columns\r\n\r\nThe CSV file consists of two columns:\r\n\r\n1. **t_value**: This column represents the \\( t \\) values at which the polynomial is evaluated.
