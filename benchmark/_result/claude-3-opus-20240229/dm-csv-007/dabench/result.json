  "system_message": "# CONTEXT #\nYou are a data scientist proficient in analyzing data. You excel at using Bash commands and Python code to solve data-related problems. You are working in a Bash environment with all necessary Python libraries installed. If you need to install additional libraries, you can use the 'pip install' command. You are starting in the /workspace directory, which contains all the data needed for your tasks. You can only use the actions provided in the ACTION SPACE to solve the task. The maximum number of steps you can take is 20.\n\n# ACTION SPACE #\n\n## Bash Action\n* Signature: Bash(code=\"shell_command\")\n* Description: This action string will execute a valid shell command in the `code` field. Only non-interactive commands are supported. Commands like \"vim\" and viewing images directly (e.g., using \"display\") are not allowed.\n* Example: Bash(code=\"ls -l\")\n\n## Python Action\n* Signature: Python(file_path=\"path/to/python_file\"):\n```python\nexecutable_python_code\n```\n* Description: This action will create a python file in the field `file_path` with the content wrapped by paired ``` symbols. If the file already exists, it will be overwritten. After creating the file, the python file will be executed. \n* Example: Python(file_path=\"./hello_world.py\"):\n```python\nprint(\"Hello, world!\")\n```\n\n## SQL Action\n* Signature: SQL(file_path=\"path/to/database_file\", command=\"sql_command\", output=\"path/to/output_file.csv\" or \"direct\")\n* Description: Executes an SQL command on the specified database file. If `output` is set to a file path, the results are saved to this CSV file; if set to 'direct', results are displayed directly.\n* Constraints:\n  - The database file must be accessible and in a format compatible with SQLite (e.g., .sqlite, .db).\n  - SQL commands must be valid and safely formatted to prevent security issues such as SQL injection.\n* Examples:\n  - Example1: SQL(file_path=\"data.sqlite\", command=\"SELECT name FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='table'\", output=\"directly\")\n  - Example2: SQL(file_path=\"data.db\", command=\"SELECT * FROM users\", output=\"users_output.csv\")\n\n## Terminate Action\n* Signature: Terminate(output=\"literal_answer_or_output_path\")\n* Description: This action denotes the completion of the entire task and returns the final answer or the output file/folder path. Make sure the output file is located in the initial workspace directory.\n* Examples:\n  - Example1: Terminate(output=\"New York\")\n  - Example2: Terminate(output=\"result.csv\")\n  - Example3: Terminate(output=\"FAIL\")\n\n\n# NOTICE #\n1. You need to fully understand the action space and its arguments before using it.\n2. You should first understand the environment and conduct data analysis on the given data before handling the task.\n3. You can't take some problems for granted. For example, you should check the existence of files before reading them.\n4. If the function execution fails, you should analyze the error and try to solve it.\n5. For challenging tasks like ML, you may need to verify the correctness of the method by checking the accuracy or other metrics, and try to optimize the method.\n6. Before finishing the task, ensure all instructions are met and verify the existence and correctness of any generated files.\n\n# RESPONSE FROMAT # \nFor each task input, your response should contain:\n1. One analysis of the task and the current environment, reasoning to determine the next action (prefix \"Thought: \").\n2.

      "observation": "## About Dataset\n\n### Background\n\nWhat can we say about the success of a movie before it is released? Are there certain companies (Pixar?) that have found a consistent formula? Given that major films costing over $100 million to produce can still flop, this question is more important than ever to the industry. Film aficionados might have different interests. Can we predict which films will be highly rated, whether or not they are a commercial success?\n\nThis is a great place to start digging in to those questions, with data on the plot, cast, crew, budget, and revenues of several thousand films.\n\n### Data Source Transfer Summary\n\nWe (Kaggle) have removed the original version of this dataset per a** **[DMCA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Millennium_Copyright_Act) takedown request from IMDB. In order to minimize the impact, we're replacing it with a similar set of films and data fields from** **[The Movie Database (TMDb)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tmdb/themoviedb.org) in accordance with** **[their terms of use](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api/terms-of-use). The bad news is that kernels built on the old dataset will most likely no longer work.\n\nThe good news is that:\n\n* You can port your existing kernels over with a bit of editing.** **[This kernel](https://www.kaggle.com/sohier/getting-imdb-kernels-working-with-tmdb-data/) offers functions and examples for doing so. You can also find** **[a general introduction to the new format here](https://www.kaggle.com/sohier/tmdb-format-introduction).\n* The new dataset contains full credits for both the cast and the crew, rather than just the first three actors.\n* Actor and actresses are now listed in the order they appear in the credits. It's unclear what ordering the original dataset used; for the movies I spot checked it didn't line up with either the credits order or IMDB's stars order.\n* The revenues appear to be more current. For example, IMDB's figures for Avatar seem to be from 2010 and understate the film's global revenues by over $2 billion.\n* Some of the movies that we weren't able to port over (a couple of hundred) were just bad entries. For example,** **[this IMDB entry](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt5289954/?ref_=fn_t%E2%80%A6) has basically no accurate information at all. It lists Star Wars Episode VII as a documentary.\n\n### Data Source Transfer Details\n\n* Several of the new columns contain json. You can save a bit of time by porting the load data functions [from this kernel]().\n* Even in simple fields like runtime may not be consistent across versions. For example, previous dataset shows the duration for Avatar's extended cut while TMDB shows the time for the original version.\n* There's now a separate file containing the full credits for both the cast and crew.\n* All fields are filled out by users so don't expect them to agree on keywords, genres, ratings, or the like.\n* Your existing kernels will continue to render normally until they are re-run.\n* If you are curious a\n[Observation too long, truncated; Try other commands to get the left part.]",
