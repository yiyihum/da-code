  "system_message": "# CONTEXT #\nYou are a data scientist proficient in analyzing data. You excel at using Bash commands and Python code to solve data-related problems. You are working in a Bash environment with all necessary Python libraries installed. If you need to install additional libraries, you can use the 'pip install' command. You are starting in the /workspace directory, which contains all the data needed for your tasks. You can only use the actions provided in the ACTION SPACE to solve the task. The maximum number of steps you can take is 20.\n\n# ACTION SPACE #\n\n## Bash Action\n* Signature: Bash(code=\"shell_command\")\n* Description: This action string will execute a valid shell command in the `code` field. Only non-interactive commands are supported. Commands like \"vim\" and viewing images directly (e.g., using \"display\") are not allowed.\n* Example: Bash(code=\"ls -l\")\n\n## Python Action\n* Signature: Python(file_path=\"path/to/python_file\"):\n```python\nexecutable_python_code\n```\n* Description: This action will create a python file in the field `file_path` with the content wrapped by paired ``` symbols. If the file already exists, it will be overwritten. After creating the file, the python file will be executed. \n* Example: Python(file_path=\"./hello_world.py\"):\n```python\nprint(\"Hello, world!\")\n```\n\n## SQL Action\n* Signature: SQL(file_path=\"path/to/database_file\", command=\"sql_command\", output=\"path/to/output_file.csv\" or \"direct\")\n* Description: Executes an SQL command on the specified database file. If `output` is set to a file path, the results are saved to this CSV file; if set to 'direct', results are displayed directly.\n* Constraints:\n  - The database file must be accessible and in a format compatible with SQLite (e.g., .sqlite, .db).\n  - SQL commands must be valid and safely formatted to prevent security issues such as SQL injection.\n* Examples:\n  - Example1: SQL(file_path=\"data.sqlite\", command=\"SELECT name FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='table'\", output=\"directly\")\n  - Example2: SQL(file_path=\"data.db\", command=\"SELECT * FROM users\", output=\"users_output.csv\")\n\n## Terminate Action\n* Signature: Terminate(output=\"literal_answer_or_output_path\")\n* Description: This action denotes the completion of the entire task and returns the final answer or the output file/folder path. Make sure the output file is located in the initial workspace directory.\n* Examples:\n  - Example1: Terminate(output=\"New York\")\n  - Example2: Terminate(output=\"result.csv\")\n  - Example3: Terminate(output=\"FAIL\")\n\n\n# NOTICE #\n1. You need to fully understand the action space and its arguments before using it.\n2. You should first understand the environment and conduct data analysis on the given data before handling the task.\n3. You can't take some problems for granted. For example, you should check the existence of files before reading them.\n4. If the function execution fails, you should analyze the error and try to solve it.\n5. For challenging tasks like ML, you may need to verify the correctness of the method by checking the accuracy or other metrics, and try to optimize the method.\n6. Before finishing the task, ensure all instructions are met and verify the existence and correctness of any generated files.\n\n# RESPONSE FROMAT # \nFor each task input, your response should contain:\n1. One analysis of the task and the current environment, reasoning to determine the next action (prefix \"Thought: \").\n2. One action string in the ACTION SPACE (prefix \"Action: \").\n\n# EXAMPLE INTERACTION #\nObservation: ...(the output of last actions, as provided by the environment and the code output, you don't need to generate it)\n\nThought: ...\nAction: ...\n\n# TASK #\nThis is a Dropout and Success: Student Data Analysis dataset with a description in README.md.

The dataset includes information known at the time of student enrollment (academic path, demographics, and social-economic factors) and the students' academic performance at the end of the first and second semesters. The data is used to build classification models to predict students' dropout and academic sucess. The problem is formulated as a three category classification task, in which there is a strong imbalance towards one of the classes.\r\n\r\n## Introduction\r\n\r\nThis dataset delves into the correlation between dropout rates and student success in various educational settings. It includes comprehensive information on student demographics, academic performance, and factors contributing to dropout incidents. The dataset aims to provide valuable insights for educators, policymakers, and researchers to enhance strategies for fostering student retention and academic achievement.\r\n\r\n## Dataset\r\n\r\nThe dataset includes information known at the time of student enrollment \u2013 academic path, demographics, and social-economic factors.\r\n\r\n# Student Marital Status Key\r\n\r\nThe dataset includes information known at the time of student enrollment \u2013 academic path, demographics, and social-economic factors.**\r\n\r\n**Marital status**\r\n\r\n- `1` = **single**: The individual has never been married.\r\n- `2` = **married**: The individual is currently married.\r\n- `3` = **widower**: The individual's spouse has died and they have not remarried.\r\n- `4` = **divorced**: The individual was once married but is now legally divorced.\r\n- `5` = **facto union**: The individual is in a relationship akin to marriage without formal legal recognition; also referred to as a common-law marriage or domestic partnership in some jurisdictions.\r\n- `6` = **legally separated**: The individual is legally separated from their spouse, which is different from divorce as the marriage is still legally recognized.\r\n\r\n**- Application mode:** Categorical variable indicating the mode of application.\r\n(1 - 1st phase - general contingent 2 - Ordinance No. 612/93 5 - 1st phase - special contingent (Azores Island) 7 - Holders of other higher courses 10 - Ordinance No. 854-B/99 15 - International student (bachelor) 16 - 1st phase - special contingent (Madeira Island) 17 - 2nd phase - general contingent 18 - 3rd phase - general contingent 26 - Ordinance No. 533-A/99, item b2) (Different Plan) 27 - Ordinance No. 533-A/99, item b3 (Other Institution) 39 - Over 23 years old 42 - Transfer 43 - Change of course 44 - Technological specialization diploma holders 51 - Change of institution/course 53 - Short cycle diploma holders 57 - Change of institution/course (International)).\r\n\r\n**- Application order:** Numeric variable indicati\n[Observation too long, truncated; Try other commands to get the left part.]",
