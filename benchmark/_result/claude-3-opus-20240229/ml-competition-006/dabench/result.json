  "system_message": "# CONTEXT #\nYou are a data scientist proficient in analyzing data. You excel at using Bash commands and Python code to solve data-related problems. You are working in a Bash environment with all necessary Python libraries installed. If you need to install additional libraries, you can use the 'pip install' command. You are starting in the /workspace directory, which contains all the data needed for your tasks. You can only use the actions provided in the ACTION SPACE to solve the task. The maximum number of steps you can take is 20.\n\n# ACTION SPACE #\n\n## Bash Action\n* Signature: Bash(code=\"shell_command\")\n* Description: This action string will execute a valid shell command in the `code` field. Only non-interactive commands are supported. Commands like \"vim\" and viewing images directly (e.g., using \"display\") are not allowed.\n* Example: Bash(code=\"ls -l\")\n\n## Python Action\n* Signature: Python(file_path=\"path/to/python_file\"):\n```python\nexecutable_python_code\n```\n* Description: This action will create a python file in the field `file_path` with the content wrapped by paired ``` symbols. If the file already exists, it will be overwritten. After creating the file, the python file will be executed. \n* Example: Python(file_path=\"./hello_world.py\"):\n```python\nprint(\"Hello, world!\")\n```\n\n## SQL Action\n* Signature: SQL(file_path=\"path/to/database_file\", command=\"sql_command\", output=\"path/to/output_file.csv\" or \"direct\")\n* Description: Executes an SQL command on the specified database file. If `output` is set to a file path, the results are saved to this CSV file; if set to 'direct', results are displayed directly.\n* Constraints:\n  - The database file must be accessible and in a format compatible with SQLite (e.g., .sqlite, .db).\n  - SQL commands must be valid and safely formatted to prevent security issues such as SQL injection.\n* Examples:\n  - Example1: SQL(file_path=\"data.sqlite\", command=\"SELECT name FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='table'\", output=\"directly\")\n  - Example2: SQL(file_path=\"data.db\", command=\"SELECT * FROM users\", output=\"users_output.csv\")\n\n## Terminate Action\n* Signature: Terminate(output=\"literal_answer_or_output_path\")\n* Description: This action denotes the completion of the entire task and returns the final answer or the output file/folder path. Make sure the output file is located in the initial workspace directory.\n* Examples:\n  - Example1: Terminate(output=\"New York\")\n  - Example2: Terminate(output=\"result.csv\")\n  - Example3: Terminate(output=\"FAIL\")\n\n\n# NOTICE #\n1. You need to fully understand the action space and its arguments before using it.\n2. You should first understand the environment and conduct data analysis on the given data before handling the task.\n3. You can't take some problems for granted. For example, you should check the existence of files before reading them.\n4. If the function execution fails, you should analyze the error and try to solve it.\n5. For challenging tasks like ML, you may need to verify the correctness of the method by checking the accuracy or other metrics, and try to optimize the method.\n6. Before finishing the task, ensure all instructions are met and verify the existence and correctness of any generated files.\n\n# RESPONSE FROMAT # \nFor each task input, your response should contain:\n1. One analysis of the task and the current environment, reasoning to determine the next action (prefix \"Thought: \").\n2.

      "observation": "## Overview\n\n**Welcome to the 2023 Kaggle Playground Series!** Thank you to everyone who participated in and contributed to Season 3 Playground Series so far!** **\n\n**Your Goal:** For this Episode of the Series, your task is to use regression to predict the quality of wine based on various properties. Good luck!\n\nStart\n\nJan 31, 2023\n\n###### Close\n\nFeb 14, 2023\n\n### Evaluation\n\nSubmissions are scored based on the quadratic weighted kappa, which measures the agreement between two outcomes. This metric typically varies from 0 (random agreement) to 1 (complete agreement). In the event that there is less agreement than expected by chance, the metric may go below 0.\n\nThe quadratic weighted kappa is calculated as follows. First, an N x N histogram matrix** ***O* is constructed, such that** ***O~i,j~* corresponds to the number of** **`Id`s** ***i* (actual) that received a predicted value** ** *j* . An** ***N-by-N** ***matrix of weights,** ** *w* , is calculated based on the difference between actual and predicted values:\n\n**\ud835\udc64**\ud835\udc56**,**\ud835\udc57**=**(**\ud835\udc56**\u2212**\ud835\udc57**)**2**(**\ud835\udc41**\u2212**1**)**2**\n\nAn** ***N-by-N* histogram matrix of expected outcomes,** ** *E* , is calculated assuming that there is no correlation between values.  This is calculated as the outer product between the actual histogram vector of outcomes and the predicted histogram vector, normalized such that** ***E* and** ***O* have the same sum.\n\nFrom these three matrices, the quadratic weighted kappa is calculated as:\n\n**\ud835\udf05**=**1**\u2212**\u2211**\ud835\udc56**,**\ud835\udc57**\ud835\udc64**\ud835\udc56**,**\ud835\udc57**\ud835\udc42**\ud835\udc56**,**\ud835\udc57**\u2211**\ud835\udc56**,**\ud835\udc57**\ud835\udc64**\ud835\udc56**,**\ud835\udc57**\ud835\udc38**\ud835\udc56**,**\ud835\udc57**.**\n\n## Submission File\n\nFor each** **`Id` in the test set, you must predict the value for the target** **`quality`. The file should contain a header and have the following format:\n\n```\nId,quality\n2056,5\n2057,7\n2058,3\netc.\n```\n\n# Wine Quality Dataset\n\n\n## About Dataset\n\n### Description:\n\nThis datasets is related to red variants of the Portuguese \"Vinho Verde\" wine.The dataset describes the amount of various chemicals present in wine and their effect on it's quality. The datasets can be viewed as classification or regression tasks. The classes are ordered and not balanced (e.g. there are much more normal wines than excellent or poor ones).Your task is to predict the quality of wine using the given data.\n\nA simple yet challenging project, to anticipate the quality of wine.\nThe complexity arises due to the fact that the dataset has fewer samples, & is highly imbalanced.\nCan you overcome these obstacles & build a good predictive model to classify them?\n\n**This data frame contains the following columns:**\n\nInput variables (based on physicochemical tests):\n1 - fixed acidity\n2 - volatile acidity\n3 - citric acid\n4 - residual sugar\n5 - chlorides\n6 - free sulfur dioxide\n7 - total sulfur dioxide\n8 - density\n9 - pH\n10 - sulphates\n11 - alcohol\nOutput variable (based on sensory data):\n12 - quality (score between 0 and 10)\n\n### Acknowledgements:\n\nThis dataset is also available from Kaggle & UCI machine learning repository,** \n[Observation too long, truncated; Try other commands to get the left part.]",
