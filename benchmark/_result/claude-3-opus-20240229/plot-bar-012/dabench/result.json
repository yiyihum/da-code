  "system_message": "# CONTEXT #\nYou are a data scientist proficient in analyzing data. You excel at using Bash commands and Python code to solve data-related problems. You are working in a Bash environment with all necessary Python libraries installed. If you need to install additional libraries, you can use the 'pip install' command. You are starting in the /workspace directory, which contains all the data needed for your tasks. You can only use the actions provided in the ACTION SPACE to solve the task. The maximum number of steps you can take is 20.\n\n# ACTION SPACE #\n\n## Bash Action\n* Signature: Bash(code=\"shell_command\")\n* Description: This action string will execute a valid shell command in the `code` field. Only non-interactive commands are supported. Commands like \"vim\" and viewing images directly (e.g., using \"display\") are not allowed.\n* Example: Bash(code=\"ls -l\")\n\n## Python Action\n* Signature: Python(file_path=\"path/to/python_file\"):\n```python\nexecutable_python_code\n```\n* Description: This action will create a python file in the field `file_path` with the content wrapped by paired ``` symbols. If the file already exists, it will be overwritten. After creating the file, the python file will be executed. \n* Example: Python(file_path=\"./hello_world.py\"):\n```python\nprint(\"Hello, world!\")\n```\n\n## SQL Action\n* Signature: SQL(file_path=\"path/to/database_file\", command=\"sql_command\", output=\"path/to/output_file.csv\" or \"direct\")\n* Description: Executes an SQL command on the specified database file. If `output` is set to a file path, the results are saved to this CSV file; if set to 'direct', results are displayed directly.\n* Constraints:\n  - The database file must be accessible and in a format compatible with SQLite (e.g., .sqlite, .db).\n  - SQL commands must be valid and safely formatted to prevent security issues such as SQL injection.\n* Examples:\n  - Example1: SQL(file_path=\"data.sqlite\", command=\"SELECT name FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='table'\", output=\"directly\")\n  - Example2: SQL(file_path=\"data.db\", command=\"SELECT * FROM users\", output=\"users_output.csv\")\n\n\n## Terminate Action\n* Signature: Terminate(output=\"literal_answer_or_output_path\")\n* Description: This action denotes the completion of the entire task and returns the final answer or the output file/folder path. Make sure the output file is located in the initial workspace directory.\n* Examples:\n  - Example1: Terminate(output=\"New York\")\n  - Example2: Terminate(output=\"result.csv\")\n  - Example3: Terminate(output=\"FAIL\")\n\n\n\n# NOTICE #\n1. You need to fully understand the action space and its arguments before using it.\n2. You should first understand the environment and conduct data analysis on the given data before handling the task.\n3. You can't take some problems for granted. For example, you should check the existence of files before reading them.\n4. If the function execution fails, you should analyze the error and try to solve it.\n5. For challenging tasks like ML, you may need to verify the correctness of the method by checking the accuracy or other metrics, and try to optimize the method.\n6. Before finishing the task, ensure all instructions are met and verify the existence and correctness of any generated files.\n\n# RESPONSE FROMAT # \nFor each task input, your response should contain:\n1. One analysis of the task and the current environment, reasoning to determine the next action (prefix \"Thought: \").\n2. One action string in the ACTION SPACE (prefix \"Action: \").\n\n# EXAMPLE INTERACTION #\nObservation: ...(the output of last actions, as provided by the environment and the code output, you don't need to generate it)\n\nThought: ...\nAction: ...\n\n# TASK #\nThis is a Student Alcohol Consumption dataset.

      "observation": "In this analysis, we categorize individuals into two distinct age groups: teenagers and adults. This classification helps us understand the different life stages and associated responsibilities, as well as the living arrangements and parental statuses of young people.\n\n1. **Teenagers**: This group includes individuals aged between 15 and 17 years old. Teenagers are typically in high school, experiencing significant developmental and social changes as they prepare for adulthood. They are at a critical juncture in their lives, balancing academic pressures with social dynamics and personal growth. Teenagers often rely heavily on their parents or guardians for support and guidance during this transitional period. They may also be involved in extracurricular activities, part-time jobs, and exploring their future career or educational paths.\n\n2. **Adults**: This group includes individuals aged 18 and older. Adults are generally considered to have reached maturity and legal independence, marking a significant shift in their responsibilities and lifestyle. They may be attending college, entering the workforce, or taking on other adult responsibilities such as managing finances, living independently, or starting a family. This age group represents a broader range of life stages, from young adulthood to middle age, encompassing a wide variety of experiences and challenges. Adults are often seen as role models for teenagers and play crucial roles in society as they contribute to the economy, community, and family life.\n\nBy categorizing individuals into these two groups, we can better understand the living arrangements and parental statuses of children and young adults between the ages of 15 and 22. This age range is particularly interesting as it covers a significant period of transition from adolescence to early adulthood. Understanding how these individuals live\u2014whether they remain with their parents, live independently, or in other arrangements\u2014can provide insights into social trends, economic factors, and cultural norms. Furthermore, analyzing the parental status (living together or apart) can shed light on family dynamics and the impact of parental support on young people's development and well-being.\n\nIn summary, this classification into teenagers and adults allows us to delve deeper into the various aspects of life for individuals in this age range, providing a comprehensive view of their experiences, challenges, and support systems.",
