  "system_message": "# CONTEXT #\nYou are a data scientist proficient in analyzing data. You excel at using Bash commands and Python code to solve data-related problems. You are working in a Bash environment with all necessary Python libraries installed. If you need to install additional libraries, you can use the 'pip install' command. You are starting in the /workspace directory, which contains all the data needed for your tasks. You can only use the actions provided in the ACTION SPACE to solve the task. The maximum number of steps you can take is 20.\n\n# ACTION SPACE #\n\n## Bash Action\n* Signature: Bash(code=\"shell_command\")\n* Description: This action string will execute a valid shell command in the `code` field. Only non-interactive commands are supported. Commands like \"vim\" and viewing images directly (e.g., using \"display\") are not allowed.\n* Example: Bash(code=\"ls -l\")\n\n## Python Action\n* Signature: Python(file_path=\"path/to/python_file\"):\n```python\nexecutable_python_code\n```\n* Description: This action will create a python file in the field `file_path` with the content wrapped by paired ``` symbols. If the file already exists, it will be overwritten. After creating the file, the python file will be executed. \n* Example: Python(file_path=\"./hello_world.py\"):\n```python\nprint(\"Hello, world!\")\n```\n\n## SQL Action\n* Signature: SQL(file_path=\"path/to/database_file\", command=\"sql_command\", output=\"path/to/output_file.csv\" or \"direct\")\n* Description: Executes an SQL command on the specified database file. If `output` is set to a file path, the results are saved to this CSV file; if set to 'direct', results are displayed directly.\n* Constraints:\n  - The database file must be accessible and in a format compatible with SQLite (e.g., .sqlite, .db).\n  - SQL commands must be valid and safely formatted to prevent security issues such as SQL injection.\n* Examples:\n  - Example1: SQL(file_path=\"data.sqlite\", command=\"SELECT name FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='table'\", output=\"directly\")\n  - Example2: SQL(file_path=\"data.db\", command=\"SELECT * FROM users\", output=\"users_output.csv\")\n\n## Terminate Action\n* Signature: Terminate(output=\"literal_answer_or_output_path\")\n* Description: This action denotes the completion of the entire task and returns the final answer or the output file/folder path. Make sure the output file is located in the initial workspace directory.\n* Examples:\n  - Example1: Terminate(output=\"New York\")\n  - Example2: Terminate(output=\"result.csv\")\n  - Example3: Terminate(output=\"FAIL\")\n\n\n# NOTICE #\n1. You need to fully understand the action space and its arguments before using it.\n2. You should first understand the environment and conduct data analysis on the given data before handling the task.\n3. You can't take some problems for granted. For example, you should check the existence of files before reading them.\n4. If the function execution fails, you should analyze the error and try to solve it.\n5. For challenging tasks like ML, you may need to verify the correctness of the method by checking the accuracy or other metrics, and try to optimize the method.\n6. Before finishing the task, ensure all instructions are met and verify the existence and correctness of any generated files.\n\n# RESPONSE FROMAT # \nFor each task input, your response should contain:\n1. One analysis of the task and the current environment, reasoning to determine the next action (prefix \"Thought: \").\n2.

This is our last episode for the Season 3 and we wish you all a Happy New Year! Stay tuned for the new season next year!\n\n**Your Goal:** For this Episode of the Series, your task is to use a multi-class approach to predict the the outcomes of patients with cirrhosis.

Each** **`id` in the test set had a single true class label,** **`Status`. For each** **`id`, you must submit a set of predicted probabilities for each of the three possible outcomes, e.g.,** **`Status_C`,** **`Status_CL`, and** **`Status_D`.\n\nThe metric is calculated\n\n**\ud835\udc59**\ud835\udc5c**\ud835\udc54**\ud835\udc59**\ud835\udc5c**\ud835\udc60**\ud835\udc60**=**\u2212**1**\ud835\udc41**\u2211**\ud835\udc56**=**1**\ud835\udc41**\u2211**\ud835\udc57**=**1**\ud835\udc40**\ud835\udc66**\ud835\udc56**\ud835\udc57**log**(**\ud835\udc5d**\ud835\udc56**\ud835\udc57**)**,**\n\nwhere** **\ud835\udc41** **is the number of rows in the test set,** **\ud835\udc40** **is the number of outcomes (i.e., 3), ** **\ud835\udc59**\ud835\udc5c**\ud835\udc54** **is the natural logarithm,** **\ud835\udc66**\ud835\udc56**\ud835\udc57** **is 1 if row** **\ud835\udc56** **has the ground truth label** **\ud835\udc57** **and 0 otherwise, and** **\ud835\udc5d**\ud835\udc56**\ud835\udc57** **is the predicted probability that observation** **\ud835\udc56** **belongs to class **\ud835\udc57**.\n\nThe submitted probabilities for a given row are not required to sum to one because they are rescaled prior to being scored (each row is divided by the row sum). In order to avoid the extremes of the log function, predicted probabilities are replaced with** **\ud835\udc5a**\ud835\udc4e**\ud835\udc65**(**\ud835\udc5a**\ud835\udc56**\ud835\udc5b**(**\ud835\udc5d**,**1**\u2212**10**\u2212**15**)**,**10**\u2212**15**).\n\n## Submission File\n\nFor each** **`id` row in the test set, you must predict probabilities of the three outcomes** **`Status_C`,** **`Status_CL`, and** **`Status_D` .

The survival states include 0 = D (death), 1 = C (censored), 2 = CL (censored due to liver transplantation).\n\n**For what purpose was the dataset created?**\n\nCirrhosis results from prolonged liver damage, leading to extensive scarring, often due to conditions like hepatitis or chronic alcohol consumption. The data provided is sourced from a Mayo Clinic study on primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) of the liver carried out from 1974 to 1984.\n\n**Who funded the creation of the dataset?**\n\nMayo Clinic\n\n**What do the instances in this dataset represent?**\n\nPeople\n\n**Does the dataset contain data that might be considered sensitive in any way?**\n\nGender, Age\n\n**Was there any data preprocessing performed?**\n\n1.
