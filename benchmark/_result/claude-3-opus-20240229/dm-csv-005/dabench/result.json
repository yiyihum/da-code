  "system_message": "# CONTEXT #\nYou are a data scientist proficient in analyzing data. You excel at using Bash commands and Python code to solve data-related problems. You are working in a Bash environment with all necessary Python libraries installed. If you need to install additional libraries, you can use the 'pip install' command. You are starting in the /workspace directory, which contains all the data needed for your tasks. You can only use the actions provided in the ACTION SPACE to solve the task. The maximum number of steps you can take is 20.\n\n# ACTION SPACE #\n\n## Bash Action\n* Signature: Bash(code=\"shell_command\")\n* Description: This action string will execute a valid shell command in the `code` field. Only non-interactive commands are supported. Commands like \"vim\" and viewing images directly (e.g., using \"display\") are not allowed.\n* Example: Bash(code=\"ls -l\")\n\n## Python Action\n* Signature: Python(file_path=\"path/to/python_file\"):\n```python\nexecutable_python_code\n```\n* Description: This action will create a python file in the field `file_path` with the content wrapped by paired ``` symbols. If the file already exists, it will be overwritten. After creating the file, the python file will be executed. \n* Example: Python(file_path=\"./hello_world.py\"):\n```python\nprint(\"Hello, world!\")\n```\n\n## SQL Action\n* Signature: SQL(file_path=\"path/to/database_file\", command=\"sql_command\", output=\"path/to/output_file.csv\" or \"direct\")\n* Description: Executes an SQL command on the specified database file. If `output` is set to a file path, the results are saved to this CSV file; if set to 'direct', results are displayed directly.\n* Constraints:\n  - The database file must be accessible and in a format compatible with SQLite (e.g., .sqlite, .db).\n  - SQL commands must be valid and safely formatted to prevent security issues such as SQL injection.\n* Examples:\n  - Example1: SQL(file_path=\"data.sqlite\", command=\"SELECT name FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='table'\", output=\"directly\")\n  - Example2: SQL(file_path=\"data.db\", command=\"SELECT * FROM users\", output=\"users_output.csv\")\n\n## Terminate Action\n* Signature: Terminate(output=\"literal_answer_or_output_path\")\n* Description: This action denotes the completion of the entire task and returns the final answer or the output file/folder path. Make sure the output file is located in the initial workspace directory.\n* Examples:\n  - Example1: Terminate(output=\"New York\")\n  - Example2: Terminate(output=\"result.csv\")\n  - Example3: Terminate(output=\"FAIL\")\n\n\n# NOTICE #\n1. You need to fully understand the action space and its arguments before using it.\n2. You should first understand the environment and conduct data analysis on the given data before handling the task.\n3. You can't take some problems for granted. For example, you should check the existence of files before reading them.\n4. If the function execution fails, you should analyze the error and try to solve it.\n5. For challenging tasks like ML, you may need to verify the correctness of the method by checking the accuracy or other metrics, and try to optimize the method.\n6. Before finishing the task, ensure all instructions are met and verify the existence and correctness of any generated files.\n\n# RESPONSE FROMAT # \nFor each task input, your response should contain:\n1.

Here is a detailed description:\r\n\r\n- A \"child\" is defined as anyone from birth up to and including 13 years of age. This category includes infants, toddlers, young children, and those in the early stages of adolescence.\r\n- A \"teenager\" is someone older than 13 but no older than 19 years. This group covers the typical teenage years, characterized by significant physical, emotional, and social development.\r\n- A \"young\" person refers to individuals older than 19 but no older than 25 years. This period often includes late adolescence and the transition into early adulthood, where many individuals complete their education and begin their careers.\r\n- An \"adult\" encompasses anyone older than 25 but no older than 65 years. This broad category covers the majority of a person's working life, including middle age, where people typically experience significant professional and personal growth.\r\n- An \"old\" person is anyone older than 65, extending up to 300 years, though this range primarily addresses the elderly population. This stage includes retirement and is often associated with a greater focus on health and longevity.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, it's worth noting that these age ranges are general guidelines and may vary based on cultural, social, and individual differences. Furthermore, while discussing age ranges, it's interesting to consider how advancements in technology, healthcare, and lifestyle changes might impact these classifications in the future. For instance, innovations in artificial intelligence and biotechnology could potentially extend the human lifespan, thereby altering our understanding of what constitutes different life stages. Also, a fun fact to ponder is that the oldest recorded age for a human is 122 years, achieved by Jeanne Calment of France.",

From e-commerce (suggest to buyers articles that could interest them) to online advertisement (suggest to users the right contents, matching their preferences), recommender systems are today unavoidable in our daily online journeys.\nIn a very general way, recommender systems are algorithms aimed at suggesting relevant items to users (items being movies to watch, text to read, products to buy or anything else depending on industries).\n\nRecommender systems are really critical in some industries as they can generate a huge amount of income when they are efficient or also be a way to stand out significantly from competitors. As a proof of the importance of recommender systems, we can mention that, a few years ago, Netflix organised a challenges (the \u201cNetflix prize\u201d) where the goal was to produce a recommender system that performs better than its own algorithm with a prize of 1 million dollars to win.\n\n![child](https://galeriemagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/StuttgartSelect.jpg)\n*Image: Stuttgart City Library | Stuttgart, Germany, PHOTO: DIETER WEINELT, FLICKR*\n\n### Content\n\nThe Book-Crossing dataset comprises 3 files.\n\n* Users:** **\n  Contains the users. Note that user IDs (`User-ID`) have been anonymized and map to integers. Demographic data is provided (`Location`,** **`Age`) if available. Otherwise, these fields contain NULL-values.\n\n* Books:** **\n  Books are identified by their respective ISBN. Invalid ISBNs have already been removed from the dataset. Moreover, some content-based information is given (`Book-Title`,** **`Book-Author`,** **`Year-Of-Publication`,** **`Publisher`), obtained from Amazon Web Services. Note that in case of several authors, only the first is provided. URLs linking to cover images are also given, appearing in three different flavours (`Image-URL-S`,** **`Image-URL-M`,** **`Image-URL-L`), i.e., small, medium, large. These URLs point to the Amazon web site.\n\n* Ratings:** **\n  Contains the book rating information. Ratings (`Book-Rating`) are either explicit, expressed on a scale from 1-10 (higher values denoting higher appreciation), or implicit, expressed by 0.\n\n### Starter Kernel(s)\n\n* [Recom I: Data Understanding and Simple Recommendation](https://www.kaggle.com/arashnic/recom-i-data-understanding-and-simple-recomm)\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nCollected by Cai-Nicolas Ziegler in a 4-week crawl (August / September 2004) from the** **[Book-Crossing community](https://www.bookcrossing.com/?) with kind permission from Ron Hornbaker, CTO of Humankind Systems.
