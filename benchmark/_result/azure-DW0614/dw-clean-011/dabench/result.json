You are working in a Bash environment with all necessary Python libraries installed. If you need to install additional libraries, you can use the 'pip install' command. You are starting in the /workspace directory, which contains all the data needed for your tasks. You can only use the actions provided in the ACTION SPACE to solve the task. The maximum number of steps you can take is 20.\n\n# ACTION SPACE #\n\n## Bash Action\n* Signature: Bash(code=\"shell_command\")\n* Description: This action string will execute a valid shell command in the `code` field. Only non-interactive commands are supported. Commands like \"vim\" and viewing images directly (e.g., using \"display\") are not allowed.\n* Example: Bash(code=\"ls -l\")\n\n## Python Action\n* Signature: Python(file_path=\"path/to/python_file\"):\n```python\nexecutable_python_code\n```\n* Description: This action will create a python file in the field `file_path` with the content wrapped by paired ``` symbols. If the file already exists, it will be overwritten. After creating the file, the python file will be executed. \n* Example: Python(file_path=\"./hello_world.py\"):\n```python\nprint(\"Hello, world!\")\n```\n\n## SQL Action\n* Signature: SQL(file_path=\"path/to/database_file\", command=\"sql_command\", output=\"path/to/output_file.csv\" or \"direct\")\n* Description: Executes an SQL command on the specified database file. If `output` is set to a file path, the results are saved to this CSV file; if set to 'direct', results are displayed directly.\n* Constraints:\n  - The database file must be accessible and in a format compatible with SQLite (e.g., .sqlite, .db).\n  - SQL commands must be valid and safely formatted to prevent security issues such as SQL injection.\n* Examples:\n  - Example1: SQL(file_path=\"data.sqlite\", command=\"SELECT name FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='table'\", output=\"directly\")\n  - Example2: SQL(file_path=\"data.db\", command=\"SELECT * FROM users\", output=\"users_output.csv\")\n\n## Terminate Action\n* Signature: Terminate(output=\"literal_answer_or_output_path\")\n* Description: This action denotes the completion of the entire task and returns the final answer or the output file/folder path. Make sure the output file is located in the initial workspace directory.\n* Examples:\n  - Example1: Terminate(output=\"New York\")\n  - Example2: Terminate(output=\"result.csv\")\n  - Example3: Terminate(output=\"FAIL\")\n\n\n# NOTICE #\n1. You need to fully understand the action space and its arguments before using it.\n2. You should first understand the environment and conduct data analysis on the given data before handling the task.\n3. You can't take some problems for granted. For example, you should check the existence of files before reading them.\n4. If the function execution fails, you should analyze the error and try to solve it.\n5. For challenging tasks like ML, you may need to verify the correctness of the method by checking the accuracy or other metrics, and try to optimize the method.\n6. Before finishing the task, ensure all instructions are met and verify the existence and correctness of any generated files.\n\n# RESPONSE FROMAT # \nFor each task input, your response should contain:\n1. One analysis of the task and the current environment, reasoning to determine the next action (prefix \"Thought: \").\n2.

It gauges customers' willingness to recommend a company's product or service to others, helping companies understand the level of customer loyalty and satisfaction.\r\n\r\n### NPS Survey Question\r\nNPS is determined by asking customers a single question:\r\n> **\"How likely is it that you would recommend our product or service to a friend or colleague?\"**\r\n\r\nCustomers respond using a scale from 0 to 10, where:\r\n- **0** means \"Not at all likely\"\r\n- **10** means \"Extremely likely\"\r\n\r\n### NPS Score Categories\r\nBased on their responses, customers are categorized into three groups:\r\n\r\n1. **Detractors**:\r\n   - **Score Range**: 0 to 6\r\n   - These customers are unhappy with the company's product or service. They may spread negative feedback and can harm the company's reputation.\r\n\r\n2. **Passives**:\r\n   - **Score Range**: 7 to 8\r\n   - These customers are satisfied but not enthusiastic. They are unlikely to actively recommend the company but also unlikely to spread negative feedback.\r\n\r\n3. **Promoters**:\r\n   - **Score Range**: 9 to 10\r\n   - These customers are highly satisfied and are likely to recommend the company to others. They can help fuel the company's growth through positive word-of-mouth.\r\n\r\n### Calculating NPS\r\nNPS is calculated using the following formula:\r\n\r\n\\[\r\n\\text{NPS} = \\% \\text{Promoters} - \\% \\text{Detractors}\r\n\\]\r\n\r\nWhere:\r\n- \\(\\% \\text{Promoters}\\) is the percentage of respondents who are Promoters.\r\n- \\(\\% \\text{Detractors}\\) is the percentage of respondents who are Detractors.\r\n\r\nThe NPS score ranges from -100 to 100:\r\n- A positive score indicates more Promoters than Detractors, suggesting overall customer satisfaction.\r\n- A negative score indicates more Detractors than Promoters, suggesting overall customer dissatisfaction.\r\n\r\n### Importance of NPS\r\nNPS is a crucial customer satisfaction metric that helps companies:\r\n- **Measure Customer Loyalty**: By understanding customers' willingness to recommend, companies can assess satisfaction and loyalty levels.\r\n- **Identify Improvement Opportunities**: By analyzing Detractors' feedback, companies can pinpoint areas needing improvement to enhance the customer experience.\r\n- **Drive Business Growth**: A high NPS typically indicates that customers are willing to recommend the company, helping to attract new customers and drive growth.\r\n\r\n### Applications of NPS\r\nNPS surveys are widely used across various industries, including retail, finance, technology, and healthcare. They provide a simple yet effective tool for companies to continually improve customer experiences, boost loyalty, and achieve long-term success.\r\n\r\n### Example\r\nSuppose 100 customers participate in an NPS survey with the following results:\r\n- 60 customers rate 9 or\n[Observation too long, truncated; Try other commands to get the left part.]",
