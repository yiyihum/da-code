You are working in a Bash environment with all necessary Python libraries installed. If you need to install additional libraries, you can use the 'pip install' command. You are starting in the /workspace directory, which contains all the data needed for your tasks. You can only use the actions provided in the ACTION SPACE to solve the task. The maximum number of steps you can take is 20.\n\n# ACTION SPACE #\n\n## Bash Action\n* Signature: Bash(code=\"shell_command\")\n* Description: This action string will execute a valid shell command in the `code` field. Only non-interactive commands are supported. Commands like \"vim\" and viewing images directly (e.g., using \"display\") are not allowed.\n* Example: Bash(code=\"ls -l\")\n\n## Python Action\n* Signature: Python(file_path=\"path/to/python_file\"):\n```python\nexecutable_python_code\n```\n* Description: This action will create a python file in the field `file_path` with the content wrapped by paired ``` symbols. If the file already exists, it will be overwritten. After creating the file, the python file will be executed. \n* Example: Python(file_path=\"./hello_world.py\"):\n```python\nprint(\"Hello, world!\")\n```\n\n## SQL Action\n* Signature: SQL(file_path=\"path/to/database_file\", command=\"sql_command\", output=\"path/to/output_file.csv\" or \"direct\")\n* Description: Executes an SQL command on the specified database file. If `output` is set to a file path, the results are saved to this CSV file; if set to 'direct', results are displayed directly.\n* Constraints:\n  - The database file must be accessible and in a format compatible with SQLite (e.g., .sqlite, .db).\n  - SQL commands must be valid and safely formatted to prevent security issues such as SQL injection.\n* Examples:\n  - Example1: SQL(file_path=\"data.sqlite\", command=\"SELECT name FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='table'\", output=\"directly\")\n  - Example2: SQL(file_path=\"data.db\", command=\"SELECT * FROM users\", output=\"users_output.csv\")\n\n## Terminate Action\n* Signature: Terminate(output=\"literal_answer_or_output_path\")\n* Description: This action denotes the completion of the entire task and returns the final answer or the output file/folder path. Make sure the output file is located in the initial workspace directory.\n* Examples:\n  - Example1: Terminate(output=\"New York\")\n  - Example2: Terminate(output=\"result.csv\")\n  - Example3: Terminate(output=\"FAIL\")\n\n\n# NOTICE #\n1. You need to fully understand the action space and its arguments before using it.\n2. You should first understand the environment and conduct data analysis on the given data before handling the task.\n3. You can't take some problems for granted. For example, you should check the existence of files before reading them.\n4. If the function execution fails, you should analyze the error and try to solve it.\n5. For challenging tasks like ML, you may need to verify the correctness of the method by checking the accuracy or other metrics, and try to optimize the method.\n6. Before finishing the task, ensure all instructions are met and verify the existence and correctness of any generated files.\n\n# RESPONSE FROMAT # \nFor each task input, your response should contain:\n1. One analysis of the task and the current environment, reasoning to determine the next action (prefix \"Thought: \").\n2.

It ensures consistency and reduces variability across the dataset, facilitating more effective data analysis and reporting. By standardizing these descriptions, we enable more straightforward comparisons and assessments of vehicle characteristics.\n\n#### Standardized 'Gear Box' Categories\n\n- **1 Speed**: Represents any single-speed transmission systems.\n- **4 Speed**: Covers all four-speed transmissions, regardless of specific naming variations.\n- **5 Speed**: Includes all five-speed transmissions, capturing manual, automatic, CVT, and other variations.\n- **6 Speed**: Encompasses six-speed gearboxes, including manual, automatic, CVT, DCT, and other related technologies.\n- **7 Speed**: Pertains to seven-speed transmissions across various technologies including DCT, DSG, and automatic.\n- **8 Speed**: Applies to eight-speed transmissions including steptronic, tiptronic, and automatic versions.\n- **9 Speed**: Involves nine-speed transmissions, particularly in automatic and tronic formats.\n- **10 Speed**: All ten-speed transmission systems.\n- **CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission)**: All forms of CVT, including enhanced versions like e-CVT.\n- **Direct Drive**: Direct drive systems.\n- **Fully Automatic**: Generic category for all fully automatic transmission systems.\n- **NaN**: Used for data entries that are not applicable or where the gearbox type is undefined or unknown.\n\n#### Standardized 'Drive Type' Categories\n\n- **FWD (Front Wheel Drive)**: Includes all variants that primarily power the front wheels.\n- **2WD (Two Wheel Drive)**: Covers all two-wheel drive systems, regardless of which two wheels are powered.\n- **RWD (Rear Wheel Drive)**: Encompasses all rear-wheel drive systems, including those with additional specifications like electronic stability programs.\n- **AWD (All Wheel Drive)**: Includes all formats of all-wheel drive systems, including those with electronic traction control and permanent setups like Audi's Quattro.\n- **4WD (Four Wheel Drive)**: Pertains to traditional four-wheel drive systems, including those marked as 4x4.\n- **NaN**: Used for drive type entries that are not applicable, undefined, or unknown.",
