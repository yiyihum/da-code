You are working in a Bash environment with all necessary Python libraries installed. If you need to install additional libraries, you can use the 'pip install' command. You are starting in the /workspace directory, which contains all the data needed for your tasks. You can only use the actions provided in the ACTION SPACE to solve the task.\n\n# ACTION SPACE #\n\n## Bash Action\n* Signature: Bash(code=\"shell_command\")\n* Description: This action string will execute a valid shell command in the `code` field.\n* Example: Bash(code=\"ls -l\")\n\n## Python Action\n* Signature: Python(filepath=\"path/to/python_file\"):\n```python\nexecutable_python_code\n```\n* Description: This action will create a python file in the field `filepath` with the content wrapped by paired ``` symbols. If the file already exists, it will be overwritten. After creating the file, the python file will be executed. \n* Example: Python(file_name=\"./hello_world.py\"):\n```python\nprint(\"Hello, world!\")\n```\n\n## SQL Action\n* Signature: SQL(file_path=\"path/to/database_file\", command=\"sql_command\", output=\"path/to/output_file.csv\" or \"direct\")\n* Description: Executes an SQL command on the specified database file. If `output` is set to a file path, the results are saved to this CSV file; if set to 'direct', results are displayed directly.\n* Constraints:\n  - The database file must be accessible and in a format compatible with SQLite (e.g., .sqlite, .db).\n  - SQL commands must be valid and safely formatted to prevent security issues such as SQL injection.\n* Examples:\n  - Example1: SQL(file_path=\"data.sqlite\", command=\"SELECT name FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='table'\", output=\"directly\")\n  - Example2: SQL(file_path=\"data.db\", command=\"SELECT * FROM users\", output=\"users_output.csv\")\n\n\n## Terminate Action\n* Signature: Terminate(output=\"literal_answer_or_output_path\")\n* Description: This action denotes the completion of the entire task and returns the final answer or the output file/folder path. Make sure the output file is located in the initial workspace directory.\n* Examples:\n  - Example1: Terminate(output=\"New York\")\n  - Example2: Terminate(output=\"result.csv\")\n  - Example3: Terminate(output=\"FAIL\")\n\n\n\n# NOTICE #\n1. You should first understand the environment and conduct data analysis before handling the task.\n1. You need to fully understand the action space and its arguments before using it.\n2. You can't take some problems for granted. For example, what's the content in the csv files, etc. But you can try to use the action space to solve the problem.\n3. If the function execution fails, you should analyze the error and try to solve it.\n4. Before finishing the task, ensure all instructions are met and verify the existence and correctness of any generated files.\n\n# RESPONSE FROMAT # \nFor each task input, your response should contain:\n1. One analysis of the task and the current environment, reasoning to determine the next action (prefix \"Thought: \").\n2. One action string in the ACTION SPACE (prefix \"Action: \").\n3. Observation is the output of your actions, as provided by the environment and the code output, you don't need to generate it.\n\n# Example interaction # \nObservation: ...\n\nThought: ...\nAction: ...\n\n# TASK #\nThis is an Amazon Books Dataset, with relevant descriptions in the README.md file.

We've collected information on different types of genres, sub-genres, and individual books like their titles, authors, prices, and ratings. By digging into this data, we hope to learn interesting things about what kinds of books are popular, how they're priced, and what people like to read. This can help us understand more about the world of books and what makes them tick on Amazon.\n\n### Dataset 1: Genre\n\n* **Title** : This column contains the main genres of books available on Amazon.\n* **Number of Sub-genres** : Indicates the count of sub-genres associated with each main genre.\n* **URL** : Provides the link to the page on Amazon where books of this genre are listed.\n\n### Dataset 2: SubGenre\n\n* **Title** : Lists the specific sub-genres within each main genre.\n* **Main Genre** : Indicates the overarching genre to which each sub-genre belongs.\n* **No. of Books** : Shows the count of books categorized under each sub-genre.\n* **URL** : Provides the link to the page on Amazon where books of this sub-genre are listed.\n\n### Dataset 3: Books_df\n\n* **Title** : The title of the book.\n* **Author** : Name of the author or publication house.\n* **Main Genre** : The main genre the book belongs to.\n* **Sub Genre** : The specific sub-genre of the book.\n* **Type** : Indicates the format of the book, such as paperback, Kindle, audiobook, or hardcover.\n* **Price** : The price of the book.\n* **Rating** : The average rating of the book given by users.\n* **No. of People Rated** : Indicates the count of users who have rated the book.\n* **URLs** : Provides the link to the book's page on Amazon for further details and purchase options.",
