You are working in a Bash environment with all necessary Python libraries installed. If you need to install additional libraries, you can use the 'pip install' command. You are starting in the /workspace directory, which contains all the data needed for your tasks. You can only use the actions provided in the ACTION SPACE to solve the task.\n\n# ACTION SPACE #\n\n## Bash Action\n* Signature: Bash(code=\"shell_command\")\n* Description: This action string will execute a valid shell command in the `code` field.\n* Example: Bash(code=\"ls -l\")\n\n## Python Action\n* Signature: Python(filepath=\"path/to/python_file\"):\n```python\nexecutable_python_code\n```\n* Description: This action will create a python file in the field `filepath` with the content wrapped by paired ``` symbols. If the file already exists, it will be overwritten. After creating the file, the python file will be executed. \n* Example: Python(file_name=\"./hello_world.py\"):\n```python\nprint(\"Hello, world!\")\n```\n\n## SQL Action\n* Signature: SQL(file_path=\"path/to/database_file\", command=\"sql_command\", output=\"path/to/output_file.csv\" or \"direct\")\n* Description: Executes an SQL command on the specified database file. If `output` is set to a file path, the results are saved to this CSV file; if set to 'direct', results are displayed directly.\n* Constraints:\n  - The database file must be accessible and in a format compatible with SQLite (e.g., .sqlite, .db).\n  - SQL commands must be valid and safely formatted to prevent security issues such as SQL injection.\n* Examples:\n  - Example1: SQL(file_path=\"data.sqlite\", command=\"SELECT name FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='table'\", output=\"directly\")\n  - Example2: SQL(file_path=\"data.db\", command=\"SELECT * FROM users\", output=\"users_output.csv\")\n\n\n## Terminate Action\n* Signature: Terminate(output=\"literal_answer_or_output_path\")\n* Description: This action denotes the completion of the entire task and returns the final answer or the output file/folder path. Make sure the output file is located in the initial workspace directory.\n* Examples:\n  - Example1: Terminate(output=\"New York\")\n  - Example2: Terminate(output=\"result.csv\")\n  - Example3: Terminate(output=\"FAIL\")\n\n\n\n# NOTICE #\n1. You should first understand the environment and conduct data analysis before handling the task.\n1. You need to fully understand the action space and its arguments before using it.\n2. You can't take some problems for granted. For example, what's the content in the csv files, etc. But you can try to use the action space to solve the problem.\n3. If the function execution fails, you should analyze the error and try to solve it.\n4. Before finishing the task, ensure all instructions are met and verify the existence and correctness of any generated files.\n\n# RESPONSE FROMAT # \nFor each task input, your response should contain:\n1. One analysis of the task and the current environment, reasoning to determine the next action (prefix \"Thought: \").\n2. One action string in the ACTION SPACE (prefix \"Action: \").\n3. Observation is the output of your actions, as provided by the environment and the code output, you don't need to generate it.\n\n# Example interaction # \nObservation: ...\n\nThought: ...\nAction: ...\n\n# TASK #\nThis is an Electoral Bonds dataset, with relevant descriptions provided in the README.md file.

They were introduced in** ****2018** as a way to promote transparency and accountability in political funding. However, there has been significant debate around the transparency of electoral bonds, particularly regarding the anonymity of donors and the lack of disclosure requirements.\n\nCritics argue that the anonymity provided by electoral bonds undermines transparency in political funding, as it makes it difficult to track the source of donations to political parties. Unlike traditional methods of political donations, such as cheques or online transfers, electoral bonds allow donors to remain anonymous, which raises concerns about the influence of undisclosed corporate or vested interests in the political process.\n\nThe lack of disclosure requirements further exacerbates these concerns. Political parties are not required to disclose the identities of donors who contribute through electoral bonds, leading to a lack of transparency and accountability in the political funding process.\n\nProponents of electoral bonds argue that they provide a legitimate and legal means for individuals and organizations to support political parties without fear of reprisal or harassment. They also argue that electoral bonds help prevent black money from entering the political system by ensuring that donations are made through legitimate banking channels.\n\nHowever, despite these arguments, the lack of transparency and disclosure requirements associated with electoral bonds remains a contentious issue in India. Many civil society organizations, opposition parties, and activists have called for greater transparency and accountability in political funding, including the disclosure of donors who contribute through electoral bonds.",
