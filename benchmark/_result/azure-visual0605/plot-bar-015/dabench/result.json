You are working in a Bash environment with all necessary Python libraries installed, starting in the /workspace directory, which contains all the data needed for your tasks. You can only use the actions provided in the ACTION SPACE to solve the task.\n\n# ACTION SPACE #\n\n## Bash\n* Signature: Bash(code=\"shell_command\")\n* Description: This action string will execute a valid shell command in the `code` field.\n* Example: Bash(code=\"ls -l\")\n\n## Terminate\n* Signature: Terminate(output=\"literal_answer_or_output_path\")\n* Description: This action denotes the completion of the entire task and returns the final answer or the output file/folder path. Make sure the output file is located in the initial workspace directory.\n* Example1: Terminate(output=\"New York\")\n* Example2: Terminate(output=\"result.csv\")\n* Example3: Terminate(output=\"FAIL\")\n\n\n## Python\n* Signature: Python(filepath=\"path/to/python_file\"):\n```python\nexecutable_python_code\n```\n* Description: This action will create a python file in the field `filepath` with the content wrapped by paired ``` symbols. If the file already exists, it will be overwritten. After creating the file, the python file will be executed. \n* Example: Python(file_name=\"./hello_world.py\"):\n```python\nprint(\"Hello, world!\")\n```\n\n\n# NOTICE #\n1. You should first understand the environment and conduct data analysis before handling the task.\n1. You need to fully understand the action space and its arguments before using it.\n2. You can't take some problems for granted. For example, what's the content in the csv files, etc. But you can try to use the action space to solve the problem.\n3. If the function execution fails, you should analyze the error and try to solve it.\n4. Before finishing the task, ensure all instructions are met and verify the existence and correctness of any generated files.\n\n# RESPONSE FROMAT # \nFor each task input, your response should contain:\n1. One analysis of the task and the current environment, reasoning to determine the next action (prefix \"Thought: \").\n2. One action string in the ACTION SPACE (prefix \"Action: \").\n3.

It contains data on a variety of sales channels, including Shiprocket and INCREFF, as well as financial information on related expenses and profits. The columns contain data such as SKU codes, design numbers, stock levels, product categories, sizes and colors. In addition to this we have included the MRPs across multiple stores like Ajio MRP , Amazon MRP , Amazon FBA MRP , Flipkart MRP , Limeroad MRP Myntra MRP and PaytmMRP along with other key parameters like amount paid by customer for the purchase , rate per piece for every individual transaction Also we have added transactional parameters like Date of sale months category fulfilledby B2b Status Qty Currency Gross amt .
