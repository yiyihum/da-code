The allure of cricket lies in its unique format and rules, attracting billions of fans worldwide. In cricket matches, teams take turns batting and fielding. Each team has the opportunity to showcase both their offensive and defensive capabilities, striving for victory with determination and grit.\n\nIn T20 international cricket matches, the relatively shorter duration and faster pace make it more suitable for the modern fast-paced lifestyle. Each game consists of 20 \"overs,\" with each \"over\" comprising 6 balls. This high-intensity contest within a short timeframe not only tests players' technical skills and physical fitness but also provides continuous excitement and thrill for the spectators, igniting their passion and excitement.\n\nCricket matches are not just sporting competitions but also cultural and social events. Whether on or off the field, cricket carries rich cultural significance and social relevance. Fans gather together, cheering for their supported teams, sharing the highs and lows of the game, fostering unity and enthusiasm that serve as a bond among people.\n\nAcross the globe, cricket is beloved by people and has become an integral part of their lives. It represents not only sport and competition but also conveys the spirit of friendship, teamwork, and striving for excellence, serving as a common cultural symbol that tightly binds people together.\n\nContent\n\nAll Indian Premier League Cricket matches between 2008 and 2016.\n\nThis is the ball by ball data of all the IPL cricket matches till season 9.\n\nThe dataset contains 2 files: deliveries.csv and matches.csv.\n\nmatches.csv contains details related to the match such as location, contesting teams, umpires, results, etc.\n\ndeliveries.csv is the ball-by-ball data of all the IPL matches including data of the batting team, batsman, bowler, non-striker, runs scored, etc\n**Indian Premier League (IPL) Teams and Abbreviations**\n\nBelow is a table mapping the full names of Indian Premier League (IPL) teams to their respective abbreviations, along with some additional notes about each team:\n\n| Full Name                   | Abbreviation | Note                                     |\n| --------------------------- | ------------ | ---------------------------------------- |\n| Mumbai Indians              | MI           | Four-time IPL champions                  |\n| Kolkata Knight Riders       | KKR          | Two-time IPL champions                   |\n| Royal Challengers Bangalore | RCB          | Runner-up in IPL 2016                    |\n| Deccan Chargers             | DC           | IPL champions in 2009                    |\n| Chennai Super Kings         | CSK          | Three-time IPL champions                 |\n| Rajasthan Royals            | RR           | Inaugural IPL champions in 2008         \n[Observation too long, truncated; Try other commands to get the left part.]",
