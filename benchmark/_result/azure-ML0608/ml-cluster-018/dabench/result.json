The InvoiceNo and StockCode might be less relevant for customer segmentation, and Description and Country are nominal with potentially high cardinality, which can be challenging to use directly in clustering.\n\nThe next step is to examine the actual data files to understand their format and to confirm the structure matches the description.

Normalization is important because the features are on different scales, and clustering algorithms like K-means are sensitive to the scale of the data. After normalization, I will use the K-means algorithm to cluster the data.

In practice, the value of `N` should be determined by analyzing the elbow graph. Additionally, the code includes a plotting step for the elbow method, which is typically used for visual inspection.
