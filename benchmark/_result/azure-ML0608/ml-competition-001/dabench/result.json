It contains information on bank customers who either left the bank or continue to be a customer. The dataset includes the following attributes:\n\n1. Customer ID: A unique identifier for each customer\n2. Surname: The customer's surname or last name\n3. Credit Score: A numerical value representing the customer's credit score\n4. Geography: The country where the customer resides (France, Spain or Germany)\n5. Gender: The customer's gender (Male or Female)\n6. Age: The customer's age.\n7. Tenure: The number of years the customer has been with the bank\n8. Balance: The customer's account balance\n9. NumOfProducts: The number of bank products the customer uses (e.g., savings account, credit card)\n10. HasCrCard: Whether the customer has a credit card (1 = yes, 0 = no)\n11. IsActiveMember: Whether the customer is an active member (1 = yes, 0 = no)\n12. EstimatedSalary: The estimated salary of the customer\n13. Exited: Whether the customer has churned (1 = yes, 0 = no)",

The goal is to predict whether a customer will churn or not, and the evaluation metric is the area under the ROC curve.

This is a persistent issue that suggests the 'id' column was somehow included in the ColumnTransformer during the model training phase. Since I cannot modify the training script or inspect the ColumnTransformer configuration directly, I need to find a workaround.\n\nGiven the constraints, I will attempt to include a dummy 'id' column in the test data to satisfy the ColumnTransformer's expectations. This dummy 'id' column will be dropped before making predictions, as it is not an actual feature but a workaround to match the expected input structure.\n\nAction: Python(filepath=\"make_predictions.py\"):\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nimport joblib\n\n# Load the trained model\nclf = joblib.load('/workspace/churn_model.joblib')\n\n# Load the test data\ntest_data = pd.read_csv('/workspace/test.csv')\n\n# Extract the customer IDs for the submission file\ncustomer_ids = test_data['CustomerId']\n\n# Add a dummy 'id' column to match the expected structure by the ColumnTransformer\ntest_data['id'] = 0\n\n# Drop the 'CustomerId' and 'Surname' columns as they are not used in the model\nX_test = test_data.drop(columns=['CustomerId', 'Surname'])\n\n# Use the preprocessor from the trained pipeline to transform the test data\n# This ensures that the test data undergoes the same preprocessing as the training data\npreprocessor = clf.named_steps['preprocessor']\nX_test_preprocessed = preprocessor.transform(X_test)\n\n# Remove the dummy 'id' column before making predictions\nX_test_preprocessed = X_test_preprocessed[:, 1:]\n\n# Predict the probabilities of churn using the trained model\nmodel = clf.named_steps['model']\ntest_preds = model.predict_proba(X_test_preprocessed)[:, 1]\n\n# Create a submission dataframe\nsubmission = pd.DataFrame({\n    'id': customer_ids,\n    'Exited': test_preds\n})\n\n# Save the submission file\nsubmission.to_csv('/workspace/submission.csv', index=False)\n```",
