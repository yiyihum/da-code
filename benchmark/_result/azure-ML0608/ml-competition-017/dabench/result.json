How far have we come from this initial competition? With an updated dataset and light years of new ideas we hope to see if we can get to the latest in automated grading to provide a real impact to overtaxed teachers who continue to have challenges with providing timely feedback, especially in underserved communities.** **\n\nThe goal of this competition is to train a model to score student essays. Your efforts are needed to reduce the high expense and time required to hand grade these essays. Reliable automated techniques could allow essays to be introduced in testing, a key indicator of student learning that is currently commonly avoided due to the challenges in grading.\n\nStart\n\n2 months ago\n\n###### Close\n\na month to go\n\nMerger & Entry\n\n### Description\n\nlink\n\nkeyboard_arrow_up\n\nEssay writing is an important method to evaluate student learning and performance. It is also time-consuming for educators to grade by hand. Automated Writing Evaluation (AWE) systems can score essays to supplement an educator\u2019s other efforts. AWEs also allow students to receive regular and timely feedback on their writing. However, due to their costs, many advancements in the field are not widely available to students and educators. Open-source solutions to assess student writing are needed to reach every community with these important educational tools.\nPrevious efforts to develop open-source AWEs have been limited by small datasets that were not nationally diverse or focused on common essay formats. The first Automated Essay Scoring competition scored student-written short-answer responses, however, this is a writing task not often used in the classroom. To improve upon earlier efforts, a more expansive dataset that includes high-quality, realistic classroom writing samples was required. Further, to broaden the impact, the dataset should include samples across economic and location populations to mitigate the potential of algorithmic bias.\nIn this competition, you will work with the largest open-access writing dataset aligned to current standards for student-appropriate assessments. Can you help produce an open-source essay scoring algorithm that improves upon the original** **[Automated Student Assessment Prize (ASAP)](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/asap-aes/overview) competition hosted in 2012?** **\nCompetition host Vanderbilt University is a private research university in Nashville, Tennessee. For this competition, Vanderbilt has partnered with The Learning Agency Lab, an Arizona-based independent nonprofit focused on developing the science of learning-based tools and programs for the social good.\nTo ensure the results of this competition are widely available, winning solutions will be released as open source.
