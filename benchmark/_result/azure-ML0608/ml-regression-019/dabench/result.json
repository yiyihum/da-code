You are working in a Bash environment with all necessary Python libraries installed. If you need to install additional libraries, you can use the 'pip install' command. You are starting in the /workspace directory, which contains all the data needed for your tasks. You can only use the actions provided in the ACTION SPACE to solve the task.\n\n# ACTION SPACE #\n\n## Bash Action\n* Signature: Bash(code=\"shell_command\")\n* Description: This action string will execute a valid shell command in the `code` field.\n* Example: Bash(code=\"ls -l\")\n\n## Python Action\n* Signature: Python(filepath=\"path/to/python_file\"):\n```python\nexecutable_python_code\n```\n* Description: This action will create a python file in the field `filepath` with the content wrapped by paired ``` symbols. If the file already exists, it will be overwritten. After creating the file, the python file will be executed. \n* Example: Python(file_name=\"./hello_world.py\"):\n```python\nprint(\"Hello, world!\")\n```\n\n## SQL Action\n* Signature: SQL(file_path=\"path/to/database_file\", command=\"sql_command\", output=\"path/to/output_file.csv\" or \"direct\")\n* Description: Executes an SQL command on the specified database file. If `output` is set to a file path, the results are saved to this CSV file; if set to 'direct', results are displayed directly.\n* Constraints:\n  - The database file must be accessible and in a format compatible with SQLite (e.g., .sqlite, .db).\n  - SQL commands must be valid and safely formatted to prevent security issues such as SQL injection.\n* Examples:\n  - Example1: SQL(file_path=\"data.sqlite\", command=\"SELECT name FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='table'\", output=\"directly\")\n  - Example2: SQL(file_path=\"data.db\", command=\"SELECT * FROM users\", output=\"users_output.csv\")\n\n\n## Terminate Action\n* Signature: Terminate(output=\"literal_answer_or_output_path\")\n* Description: This action denotes the completion of the entire task and returns the final answer or the output file/folder path.

Moreover, 17 additional measurement profiles were added, expanding the dataset from 138 hours to 185 hours of records.\n\n## Context\n\nThe data set comprises several sensor data collected from a permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) deployed on a test bench. The PMSM represents a german OEM's prototype model. Test bench measurements were collected by the** **[LEA department](https://ei.uni-paderborn.de/en/lea/) at Paderborn University.** **\n\n## Content\n\nAll recordings are sampled at 2 Hz. The data set consists of multiple measurement sessions, which can be distinguished from each other by column \"profile_id\". A measurement session can be between one and six hours long.\n\nThe motor is excited by hand-designed driving cycles denoting a reference motor speed and a reference torque.\nCurrents in d/q-coordinates (columns \"i_d\" and i_q\") and voltages in d/q-coordinates (columns \"u_d\" and \"u_q\") are a result of a standard control strategy trying to follow the reference speed and torque.\nColumns \"motor_speed\" and \"torque\" are the resulting quantities achieved by that strategy, derived from set currents and voltages.\n\nMost driving cycles denote random walks in the speed-torque-plane in order to imitate real world driving cycles to a more accurate degree than constant excitations and ramp-ups and -downs would.\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nSeveral publications leveraged the setup of the PMSM in the Paderborn University Lab:\n\n### Temperature Estimation on the same motor but different data\n\n* [Determination of rotor temperature for an interior permanent magnet synchronous machine using a precise flux observer](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6869784)\n* [Investigation of Long Short-Term Memory Networks to Temperature Prediction for Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motors](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7966088)\n* [Real-Time Capable Methods to Determine the Magnet Temperature of Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motors \u2014 A Review](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7048594)\n* [Improved Fusion of Permanent Magnet Temperature Estimation Techniques for Synchronous Motors Using a Kalman Filter](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8672935)\n* [Fusion of a lumped-parameter thermal network and speed-dependent flux observer for PM temperature estimation in synchronous machines](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8333640)\n* [Fusion of direct and indirect temperature estimation techniques for permanent magnet synchronous motors](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8002038)\n* [Sensitivity analysis of a permanent magnet temperature observer for PM synchronous machines using the Monte Carlo method](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8289188)\n* [Observing the Permanent-Magnet Temperature of Synchro\n[Observation too long, truncated; Try other commands to get the left part.]",

These features are likely to be used as input variables for predicting the rotor temperature (pm).\n\nTo proceed with the prediction, I need to create a Python script that will load the test.csv data, perform any necessary preprocessing, build or load a predictive model, and then use the model to predict the rotor temperature.
