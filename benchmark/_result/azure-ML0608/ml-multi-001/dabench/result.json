The objective is to classify activities into one of the six activities performed.\n\n### Description of experiment\n\nThe experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data.\n\nThe sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain.\n\n### Attribute information\n\nFor each record in the dataset the following is provided:\n\nTriaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.\n\nTriaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope.\n\nA 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables.\n\nIts activity label.\n\nAn identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.\n\n### Relevant papers\n\nDavide Anguita, Alessandro Ghio, Luca Oneto, Xavier Parra and Jorge L.
