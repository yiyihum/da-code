For clustering, attributes like Quantity, UnitPrice, and Country could be relevant. CustomerID might be used to aggregate transactions by customer. However, InvoiceNo and StockCode are nominal and might not be directly useful for clustering unless we transform them into meaningful features, such as total spend per invoice or number of unique products purchased. Description is nominal and text-based, which would require text processing to be useful. InvoiceDate could be used to derive features like recency of purchase.
