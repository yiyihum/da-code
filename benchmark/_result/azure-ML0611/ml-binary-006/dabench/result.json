Two federal appeals courts, one in Washington and one in Virginia, last week rejected the administration\u2019s request to put on hold orders by lower court judges requiring the military to begin accepting transgender recruits on Jan. 1. A Justice Department official said the administration will not challenge those rulings. \u201cThe Department of Defense has announced that it will be releasing an independent study of these issues in the coming weeks. So rather than litigate this interim appeal before that occurs, the administration has decided to wait for DOD\u2019s study and will continue to defend the president\u2019s lawful authority in District Court in the meantime,\u201d the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. In September, the Pentagon said it had created a panel of senior officials to study how to implement a directive by Trump to prohibit transgender individuals from serving. The Defense Department has until Feb. 21 to submit a plan to Trump. Lawyers representing currently-serving transgender service members and aspiring recruits said they had expected the administration to appeal the rulings to the conservative-majority Supreme Court, but were hoping that would not happen. Pentagon spokeswoman Heather Babb said in a statement: \u201cAs mandated by court order, the Department of Defense is prepared to begin accessing transgender applicants for military service Jan. 1. All applicants must meet all accession standards.\u201d Jennifer Levi, a lawyer with gay, lesbian and transgender advocacy group GLAD, called the decision not to appeal \u201cgreat news.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m hoping it means the government has come to see that there is no way to justify a ban and that it\u2019s not good for the military or our country,\u201d Levi said. Both GLAD and the American Civil Liberties Union represent plaintiffs in the lawsuits filed against the administration. In a move that appealed to his hard-line conservative supporters, Trump announced in July that he would prohibit transgender people from serving in the military, reversing Democratic President Barack Obama\u2019s policy of accepting them. Trump said on Twitter at the time that the military \u201ccannot be burdened with the tremendous medical costs and disruption that transgender in the military would entail.\u201d Four federal judges - in Baltimore, Washington, D.C., Seattle and Riverside, California - have issued rulings blocking Trump\u2019s ban while legal challenges to the Republican president\u2019s policy proceed. The judges said the ban would likely violate the right under the U.S. Constitution to equal protection under the law.

As the NRA tells us   constantly   these individuals, these  good guys with guns,  are ready to leap into action at the first sign of danger to protect the innocent from  bad guys with guns. Unfortunately, the problem is that the  good guys  often can become  bad guys  the moment they get a little bit angry  something we saw unfold on Friday and Saturday in Uvalde, Texas. Four people are dead after a 19-hour standoff with police at a trailer park.  It s a mess in there right now,  a Uvalde County Sheriff s Office deputy told News 4 San Antonio.Details are scarce, but police have announced that no officers were hurt in the battle with an unannounced number of gunmen and/or women. Uvalde County Sheriff s had responded to reports of shots fired at the trailer park. After police arrived, the suspects opened fire on responding officers   none of whom were hurt, fortunately. People in the trailer park and in neighboring homes were not permitted into the area while the blood battle between  good guys with guns  and police.Unfortunately, the mass proliferation of guns in the United States creates a situation where no one is ever truly safe   not in their homes, not in church, not walking down the street, or anywhere else. The lie that a  good guy with a gun  will save the day is a gross misrepresentation of reality. In fact, they re just as likely to score a headshot on the person they are  saving  as to actually save someone.While many argue that it s their right to carry their self-confidence on their hips, the fact is that keeping a gun around actually makes you less safe than having no gun at all  and then, of course, there s the chance that any  responsible gun owner  could snap at any time and start shooting. While it s true that we don t know what sparked this shootout, we can safely assume that the people who turned their guns on police surely thought of themselves as the  good guys.

On Tuesday morning, Emanuel unveiled a $9.8 billion city spending plan for fiscal 2017 that includes $3.7 billion for operations, relying on $82.3 million in revenue growth, savings from efficiencies and a few one-time measures. Since winning re-election last year, the Democratic mayor has been dealing with racially charged fallout from the 2014 police shooting of a black teenager and the pension-driven financial hardships facing the city and its school system. \u201cIt is a budget free of an immediate pension crisis, free of the black cloud of insolvency threatening the retirements of city employees and the financial future of Chicago,\u201d Emanuel told the city council. Twelve hours earlier, he signed off on a four-year tentative contract deal with teachers in the country\u2019s third-largest public school system to avert what would have been a third strike in four years. The pact, which still must be ratified by the Chicago Teachers Union, relies on a bigger injection of surplus revenue he controls from the city\u2019s development districts. To be sure, the spate of good news for Emanuel does not mean the mayor is free of political trouble. In 2016, Emanuel reeled from the effects of street protests stemming from the death of unarmed, 17-year-old Laquan McDonald, whom a white police officer shot 16 times. Emanuel\u2019s administration kept a police video of the killing under wraps while he ran for re-election last year. More broadly, street violence in Chicago continues unabated, leaving the city with more murders this year than New York City and Los Angeles combined. The city budget Emanuel outlined accommodates the initial phase of a two-year plan to add 970 police positions to address the city\u2019s sharp spike in violence. \u201cUntil we see the focus on crime in the city and the policing issue from the mayor in more ways than we saw this summer, which was not a lot of focus until it was absolutely necessary, that\u2019s one of the biggest issues in the city,\u201d said Alderman Scott Waguespack, an Emanuel critic and member of the city council\u2019s progressive bloc. Financially, the city has faced a series of credit rating downgrades due to an unfunded pension liability that Moody\u2019s Investors Service has said is the highest among U.S. municipalities it rates. That liability stood at $33.8 billion at the end of fiscal 2015 for Chicago\u2019s four retirement systems.  The mayor last year pushed through a $543 million phased-in property tax increase for police and firefighter retirement systems. The city enacted a new tax on water and sewer usage last month to rescue its largest pension fund for municipal workers from insolvency.
