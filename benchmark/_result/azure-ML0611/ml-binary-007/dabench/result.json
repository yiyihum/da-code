You are working in a Bash environment with all necessary Python libraries installed. If you need to install additional libraries, you can use the 'pip install' command. You are starting in the /workspace directory, which contains all the data needed for your tasks. You can only use the actions provided in the ACTION SPACE to solve the task. The maximum number of steps you can take is 20.\n\n# ACTION SPACE #\n\n## Bash Action\n* Signature: Bash(code=\"shell_command\")\n* Description: This action string will execute a valid shell command in the `code` field.\n* Example: Bash(code=\"ls -l\")\n\n## Python Action\n* Signature: Python(filepath=\"path/to/python_file\"):\n```python\nexecutable_python_code\n```\n* Description: This action will create a python file in the field `filepath` with the content wrapped by paired ``` symbols. If the file already exists, it will be overwritten. After creating the file, the python file will be executed. \n* Example: Python(file_name=\"./hello_world.py\"):\n```python\nprint(\"Hello, world!\")\n```\n\n## SQL Action\n* Signature: SQL(file_path=\"path/to/database_file\", command=\"sql_command\", output=\"path/to/output_file.csv\" or \"direct\")\n* Description: Executes an SQL command on the specified database file. If `output` is set to a file path, the results are saved to this CSV file; if set to 'direct', results are displayed directly.\n* Constraints:\n  - The database file must be accessible and in a format compatible with SQLite (e.g., .sqlite, .db).\n  - SQL commands must be valid and safely formatted to prevent security issues such as SQL injection.\n* Examples:\n  - Example1: SQL(file_path=\"data.sqlite\", command=\"SELECT name FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='table'\", output=\"directly\")\n  - Example2: SQL(file_path=\"data.db\", command=\"SELECT * FROM users\", output=\"users_output.csv\")\n\n\n## Terminate Action\n* Signature: Terminate(output=\"literal_answer_or_output_path\")\n* Description: This action denotes the completion of the entire task and returns the final answer or the output file/folder path.

It represents the rate at which customers stop using a company's products or services within a specific period. Churn is an important metric for businesses as it directly impacts revenue, growth, and customer retention.\n\nIn the context of the Churn dataset, the churn label indicates whether a customer has churned or not. A churned customer is one who has decided to discontinue their subscription or usage of the company's services. On the other hand, a non-churned customer is one who continues to remain engaged and retains their relationship with the company.\n\nUnderstanding customer churn is crucial for businesses to identify patterns, factors, and indicators that contribute to customer attrition. By analyzing churn behavior and its associated features, companies can develop strategies to retain existing customers, improve customer satisfaction, and reduce customer turnover. Predictive modeling techniques can also be applied to forecast and proactively address potential churn, enabling companies to take proactive measures to retain at-risk customers.",
