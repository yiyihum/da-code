You are working in a Bash environment with all necessary Python libraries installed. If you need to install additional libraries, you can use the 'pip install' command. You are starting in the /workspace directory, which contains all the data needed for your tasks. You can only use the actions provided in the ACTION SPACE to solve the task. The maximum number of steps you can take is 20.\n\n# ACTION SPACE #\n\n## Bash Action\n* Signature: Bash(code=\"shell_command\")\n* Description: This action string will execute a valid shell command in the `code` field.\n* Example: Bash(code=\"ls -l\")\n\n## Python Action\n* Signature: Python(filepath=\"path/to/python_file\"):\n```python\nexecutable_python_code\n```\n* Description: This action will create a python file in the field `filepath` with the content wrapped by paired ``` symbols. If the file already exists, it will be overwritten. After creating the file, the python file will be executed. \n* Example: Python(file_name=\"./hello_world.py\"):\n```python\nprint(\"Hello, world!\")\n```\n\n## SQL Action\n* Signature: SQL(file_path=\"path/to/database_file\", command=\"sql_command\", output=\"path/to/output_file.csv\" or \"direct\")\n* Description: Executes an SQL command on the specified database file. If `output` is set to a file path, the results are saved to this CSV file; if set to 'direct', results are displayed directly.\n* Constraints:\n  - The database file must be accessible and in a format compatible with SQLite (e.g., .sqlite, .db).\n  - SQL commands must be valid and safely formatted to prevent security issues such as SQL injection.\n* Examples:\n  - Example1: SQL(file_path=\"data.sqlite\", command=\"SELECT name FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='table'\", output=\"directly\")\n  - Example2: SQL(file_path=\"data.db\", command=\"SELECT * FROM users\", output=\"users_output.csv\")\n\n\n## Terminate Action\n* Signature: Terminate(output=\"literal_answer_or_output_path\")\n* Description: This action denotes the completion of the entire task and returns the final answer or the output file/folder path.

In this competition, we hope to foster open research and transparency on AI detection techniques applicable in the real world.\n\nThis competition challenges participants to develop a machine learning model that can accurately detect whether an essay was written by a student or an LLM. The competition dataset comprises a mix of student-written essays and essays generated by a variety of LLMs.\n\nStart\n\nNov 1, 2023\n\n###### Close\n\nJan 23, 2024\n\nMerger & Entry\n\n### Description\n\nlink\n\nkeyboard_arrow_up\n\nCan you help build a model to identify which essay was written by middle and high school students, and which was written using a large language model? With the spread of LLMs, many people fear they will replace or alter work that would usually be done by humans. Educators are especially concerned about their impact on students\u2019 skill development, though many remain optimistic that LLMs will ultimately be a useful tool to help students improve their writing skills.\n\nAt the forefront of academic concerns about LLMs is their potential to enable plagiarism. LLMs are trained on a massive dataset of text and code, which means that they are able to generate text that is very similar to human-written text. For example, students could use LLMs to generate essays that are not their own, missing crucial learning keystones. Your work on this competition can help identify telltale LLM artifacts and advance the state of the art in LLM text detection. By using texts of moderate length on a variety of subjects and multiple, unknown generative models, we aim to replicate typical detection scenarios and incentivize learning features that generalize across models.\n\nVanderbilt University, together with The Learning Agency Lab, an independent nonprofit based in Arizona, have collaborated with Kaggle on this competition** **\n\n### Acknowledgments\n\nVanderbilt University and the Learning Agency Lab would like to thank the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Schmidt Futures, and Chan Zuckerberg Initiative for their support in making this work possible.** **\n\n[![](https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-media/competitions/The%20Learning%20Agency/BMGF_logo_black_300dpi%20(1).jpg)         ](https://www.gatesfoundation.org/)[![](https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-media/competitions/The%20Learning%20Agency/Schmidt%20Futures%20Logo.png)        ](https://schmidtfutures.com/)[![](https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-media/competitions/The%20Learning%20Agency/1200px-Chan_Zuckerberg_Initiative.svg.png)         ](https://chanzuckerberg.com/)\n\n### Evaluation\n\nlink\n\nkeyboard_arrow_up\n\nSubmissions are evaluated on** **[area under the ROC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_operating_characteristic) curve between the predicted probability and the observed target.\n\n## Submission File\n\nFor each** **`id` in the test\n[Observation too long, truncated; Try other commands to get the left part.]",

It is an amazing thing to think if every person doesn't drive in one big city that it saves so much pollution going in to the air. Another thing to think about is if everyone in a city didn't drive and walked everywhere, more people would stay healthier by staying in shape. Some people think that owning a car is more stressful than just walking everywhere. If you don't own a car you don't have to pay for insurance, don't have to pay for gas, and don't have to pay for repairs when something goes wrong in a vehicle. To me it sounds like there is a lot of advantages in limiting car use.\n\nOne solid reason why not using cars as much is the pollution going in the air. In Paris, France motorists with even numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at their house or else they would be fined. The next day odd numbered license plates motorists had to leave their vehicles at home. It was a hardship at first to get people to follow these new rules, but after about five days everything started to cool down. The pollution had dropped 60 percent in Paris which is exactly what the city was looking for. Limiting the car usage didn't just save pollution from going in the air, but also there wasn't as much traffic as there usually was. It also made Paris a safer place to be outside and not damage the citizens lungs. The capital city of France also made transportation free MondayFriday to help the cause. Soon enough people that had both license plates could drive on the same day.\n\nIn Bogota, Colombia they do a car free day that is becoming popular in that part of the world. It is awesome to think there are 7 million people in that city and none of them are using a car. People that violated this goal on this day were charged a 25 fine. People from other countries came to see how this day worked and they loved it. The mayor of Asuncion, Paraguay said \"\"These people are generating a revolutionary change, and this is crossing borders.\"\" You can just imagine all the benefits of everyone not using a car in a city for a whole day. Restaurants and parks would be visited and used more and everyone would be getting more exercise. All in all this idea was genius.\n\nAs you can see limiting car usage can help out the area big time that it is taking place. It is better breathing air, businesses like restaurants and parks would be used more and grow steadily, and the city would be taken care of better.\"\n81977e6c,0,\"Limiting car usage could have many advantages on our planet. Many cities, such as Vauban in Germany, have given up on using cars to help the world around them. \"\"vaughn's streets are completely carfree,except the main thoroughfare, where the tram to downtown Freiburg runs, and a few streets on one edge of the community.\"\" There is a movement going on called, \"\"smart planning\"\" and Vauban is just one example of a growing trend in Europe of limiting auto use.
