In this competition, we hope to foster open research and transparency on AI detection techniques applicable in the real world.\n\nThis competition challenges participants to develop a machine learning model that can accurately detect whether an essay was written by a student or an LLM. The competition dataset comprises a mix of student-written essays and essays generated by a variety of LLMs.\n\nStart\n\nNov 1, 2023\n\n###### Close\n\nJan 23, 2024\n\nMerger & Entry\n\n### Description\n\nlink\n\nkeyboard_arrow_up\n\nCan you help build a model to identify which essay was written by middle and high school students, and which was written using a large language model? With the spread of LLMs, many people fear they will replace or alter work that would usually be done by humans. Educators are especially concerned about their impact on students\u2019 skill development, though many remain optimistic that LLMs will ultimately be a useful tool to help students improve their writing skills.\n\nAt the forefront of academic concerns about LLMs is their potential to enable plagiarism. LLMs are trained on a massive dataset of text and code, which means that they are able to generate text that is very similar to human-written text. For example, students could use LLMs to generate essays that are not their own, missing crucial learning keystones. Your work on this competition can help identify telltale LLM artifacts and advance the state of the art in LLM text detection. By using texts of moderate length on a variety of subjects and multiple, unknown generative models, we aim to replicate typical detection scenarios and incentivize learning features that generalize across models.\n\nVanderbilt University, together with The Learning Agency Lab, an independent nonprofit based in Arizona, have collaborated with Kaggle on this competition** **\n\n### Acknowledgments\n\nVanderbilt University and the Learning Agency Lab would like to thank the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Schmidt Futures, and Chan Zuckerberg Initiative for their support in making this work possible.** **\n\n[![](https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-media/competitions/The%20Learning%20Agency/BMGF_logo_black_300dpi%20(1).jpg)         ](https://www.gatesfoundation.org/)[![](https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-media/competitions/The%20Learning%20Agency/Schmidt%20Futures%20Logo.png)        ](https://schmidtfutures.com/)[![](https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-media/competitions/The%20Learning%20Agency/1200px-Chan_Zuckerberg_Initiative.svg.png)         ](https://chanzuckerberg.com/)\n\n### Evaluation\n\nlink\n\nkeyboard_arrow_up\n\nSubmissions are evaluated on** **[area under the ROC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_operating_characteristic) curve between the predicted probability and the observed target.\n\n## Submission File\n\nFor each** **`id` in the test\n[Observation too long, truncated; Try other commands to get the left part.]",

It is an amazing thing to think if every person doesn't drive in one big city that it saves so much pollution going in to the air. Another thing to think about is if everyone in a city didn't drive and walked everywhere, more people would stay healthier by staying in shape. Some people think that owning a car is more stressful than just walking everywhere. If you don't own a car you don't have to pay for insurance, don't have to pay for gas, and don't have to pay for repairs when something goes wrong in a vehicle. To me it sounds like there is a lot of advantages in limiting car use.\n\nOne solid reason why not using cars as much is the pollution going in the air. In Paris, France motorists with even numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at their house or else they would be fined. The next day odd numbered license plates motorists had to leave their vehicles at home. It was a hardship at first to get people to follow these new rules, but after about five days everything started to cool down. The pollution had dropped 60 percent in Paris which is exactly what the city was looking for. Limiting the car usage didn't just save pollution from going in the air, but also there wasn't as much traffic as there usually was. It also made Paris a safer place to be outside and not damage the citizens lungs. The capital city of France also made transportation free MondayFriday to help the cause. Soon enough people that had both license plates could drive on the same day.\n\nIn Bogota, Colombia they do a car free day that is becoming popular in that part of the world. It is awesome to think there are 7 million people in that city and none of them are using a car. People that violated this goal on this day were charged a 25 fine. People from other countries came to see how this day worked and they loved it. The mayor of Asuncion, Paraguay said \"\"These people are generating a revolutionary change, and this is crossing borders.\"\" You can just imagine all the benefits of everyone not using a car in a city for a whole day. Restaurants and parks would be visited and used more and everyone would be getting more exercise. All in all this idea was genius.\n\nAs you can see limiting car usage can help out the area big time that it is taking place. It is better breathing air, businesses like restaurants and parks would be used more and grow steadily, and the city would be taken care of better.\",70d7c567,0\n\"Limiting car usage could have many advantages on our planet. Many cities, such as Vauban in Germany, have given up on using cars to help the world around them. \"\"vaughn's streets are completely carfree,except the main thoroughfare, where the tram to downtown Freiburg runs, and a few streets on one edge of the community.\"\" There is a movement going on called, \"\"smart planning\"\" and Vauban is just one example of a growing trend in Europe of limiting auto use.

But, as much as we use automobiles do we really need them? They produce smog, endanger our children and folk, and make life more stressing for us all. This can be fixed though, many places around the world have stoped using cars and even went to the length of banning them! Most importantly though they have opened our eyes to the atmospheric destruction that is caused by cars and ways we can do without them.\n\nIn Paris, a few days after nearrecord pollution, France banned driving for a couple days to clear the air or drivers will be fined up to 22 euros, or 31 dollars in America. \"\"Congestion was down 60% in the capital of France, after five days of intensifying in smog that rivaled Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world,\"\" says Robert Duffer, a journalist for Paris Robert Duffer, par. 14. This amazing number just shows how even reducing the use of cars cut back the smog by over half! Imagine what our air could be like if we didn't use cars, it would help the ill and our children could breathe easily. And surprisingly enough, there are places already that do this act of banning cars and enforce it.\n\nIn Vauban, Germany there is a community of people who live in this fashion. Street parking, garages, and even driveways at homes are banned from this quaint suburban area. And, if you do own a car you have to pay almost 40,000 to park it, needless to say over 70% of families of the area don't own a car and 57% sold theirs to move to the area. A mother of two and resident of the area, Heidrun Wlater, says, \"\"When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,\"\" Elisabeth Rosenthal par. 3. And true to their word these kinds of urban areas have become popular in Europe and even in New York.\n\nCar free areas have not been limited to just Europe though in America, with its large areas of urban annd suburban ideals, is now changing the way the way we think about cars. In April 2013, the miles driven per person was 9% lower than it was in January 1995 32. Although small, this cultural change in the way we are using cars is significant. Michael Sivak, a research professor at the University of Michigan's Transportation Research Institute says, \"\"What most intrigues me is that the rates of car ownershipper household and pe person started to come down 2 or 3 years before the downturn, I think that means something more fundamental is going on,\"\" Elisabeth Rosenthal par. 33. The fact that America is changing the way we use cars is just another indicator that we should stop all together and join this carfree revolution.\n\nTo wrap it up, cars are hurting the air and they need to be cut back before we burn a hole through our atmoshpere. We're not alone in this carfree quest, many areas Europe and nothern America have started to implement this way of thinkin\n[Observation too long, truncated; Try other commands to get the left part.]",
