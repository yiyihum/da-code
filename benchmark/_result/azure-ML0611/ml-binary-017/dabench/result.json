Other columns have fewer missing values.\n\nTo handle the missing values, I can either impute them using statistical methods (like mean or median for numerical features, or mode for categorical features) or drop the rows/columns with missing values if they are not significant. Given the large number of missing values in some columns, it might be more appropriate to impute them to avoid losing too much data.\n\nSince the task is to predict whether it will rain tomorrow, I will focus on the features that are most likely to influence this outcome. Features like 'Date' and 'Location' may not be directly useful for prediction in their raw form but could be engineered into more useful features if needed.\n\nThe next step is to preprocess the data by handling missing values and preparing the dataset for model training. I will write a Python script to impute missing values for numerical columns with the median and for categorical columns with the mode.

One-hot encoding is generally preferred for categorical variables that do not have an ordinal relationship.
