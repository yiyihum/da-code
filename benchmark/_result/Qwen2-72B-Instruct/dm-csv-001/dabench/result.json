You are working in a Bash environment with all necessary Python libraries installed. If you need to install additional libraries, you can use the 'pip install' command. You are starting in the /workspace directory, which contains all the data needed for your tasks. You can only use the actions provided in the ACTION SPACE to solve the task. The maximum number of steps you can take is 20.\n\n# ACTION SPACE #\n\n## Bash Action\n* Signature: Bash(code=\"shell_command\")\n* Description: This action string will execute a valid shell command in the `code` field. Only non-interactive commands are supported. Commands like \"vim\" and viewing images directly (e.g., using \"display\") are not allowed.\n* Example: Bash(code=\"ls -l\")\n\n## Python Action\n* Signature: Python(file_path=\"path/to/python_file\"):\n```python\nexecutable_python_code\n```\n* Description: This action will create a python file in the field `file_path` with the content wrapped by paired ``` symbols. If the file already exists, it will be overwritten. After creating the file, the python file will be executed. \n* Example: Python(file_path=\"./hello_world.py\"):\n```python\nprint(\"Hello, world!\")\n```\n\n## SQL Action\n* Signature: SQL(file_path=\"path/to/database_file\", command=\"sql_command\", output=\"path/to/output_file.csv\" or \"direct\")\n* Description: Executes an SQL command on the specified database file. If `output` is set to a file path, the results are saved to this CSV file; if set to 'direct', results are displayed directly.\n* Constraints:\n  - The database file must be accessible and in a format compatible with SQLite (e.g., .sqlite, .db).\n  - SQL commands must be valid and safely formatted to prevent security issues such as SQL injection.\n* Examples:\n  - Example1: SQL(file_path=\"data.sqlite\", command=\"SELECT name FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='table'\", output=\"directly\")\n  - Example2: SQL(file_path=\"data.db\", command=\"SELECT * FROM users\", output=\"users_output.csv\")\n\n## Terminate Action\n* Signature: Terminate(output=\"literal_answer_or_output_path\")\n* Description: This action denotes the completion of the entire task and returns the final answer or the output file/folder path. Make sure the output file is located in the initial workspace directory.\n* Examples:\n  - Example1: Terminate(output=\"New York\")\n  - Example2: Terminate(output=\"result.csv\")\n  - Example3: Terminate(output=\"FAIL\")\n\n\n# NOTICE #\n1. You need to fully understand the action space and its arguments before using it.\n2. You should first understand the environment and conduct data analysis on the given data before handling the task.\n3. You can't take some problems for granted. For example, you should check the existence of files before reading them.\n4. If the function execution fails, you should analyze the error and try to solve it.\n5. For challenging tasks like ML, you may need to verify the correctness of the method by checking the accuracy or other metrics, and try to optimize the method.\n6. Before finishing the task, ensure all instructions are met and verify the existence and correctness of any generated files.\n\n# RESPONSE FROMAT # \nFor each task input, your response should contain:\n1. One analysis of the task and the current environment, reasoning to determine the next action (prefix \"Thought: \").\n2. One action string in the ACTION SPACE (prefix \"Action: \").\n\n# EXAMPLE INTERACTION #\nObservation: ...(the output of last actions, as provided by the environment and the code output, you don't need to generate it)\n\nThought: ...\nAction: ...\n\n# TASK #\nThis is a UFC Fighters\u2019 Statistics 2024 dataset with a description in README.md.

This classification ensures fairness and competitiveness, as it matches opponents of similar body mass and strength. Here\u2019s a detailed breakdown of the UFC weight classes based on the fighters' weight in kilograms (kg):\n\n#### Weight Class Standards:\n\n1. **Unknown Weight Class**\n   - Condition: Fighter's weight is not available (`NaN` in data).\n   - This category is used for record-keeping in databases when a fighter\u2019s weight is not provided.\n\n2. **Flyweight**\n   - Up to 57.0 kg\n   - Fighters who weigh 57.0 kg or less fall into the flyweight category, typically showcasing speed and agility.\n\n3. **Bantamweight**\n   - 57.1 kg to 61.2 kg\n   - This weight class captures fighters slightly heavier than flyweights, offering a mix of agility and more power.\n\n4. **Featherweight**\n   - 61.3 kg to 65.8 kg\n   - Featherweight fighters often display a balance of quickness and endurance, with a slight increase in knockout power.\n\n5. **Lightweight**\n   - 65.9 kg to 70.0 kg\n   - Known for its competitive nature, the lightweight division features fighters with good speed, endurance, and stronger knockout capabilities.\n\n6. **Welterweight**\n   - 70.1 kg to 77.1 kg\n   - Welterweights are recognized for their powerful physiques and well-rounded skill sets in striking and grappling.\n\n7. **Middleweight**\n   - 77.2 kg to 83.9 kg\n   - This class includes fighters who possess significant strength and endurance, often leading to more dramatic knockouts.\n\n8. **Light Heavyweight**\n   - 84.0 kg to 93.0 kg\n   - Light heavyweights combine the agility of lighter fighters with the power of heavyweights, making this a very dynamic division.\n\n9. **Heavyweight**\n   - Above 93.0 kg\n   - The heavyweight division features the largest and often most powerful fighters in the UFC, with a focus on strength and knockout power.",
