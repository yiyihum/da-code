You are working in a Bash environment with all necessary Python libraries installed. If you need to install additional libraries, you can use the 'pip install' command. You are starting in the /workspace directory, which contains all the data needed for your tasks. You can only use the actions provided in the ACTION SPACE to solve the task. The maximum number of steps you can take is 20.\n\n# ACTION SPACE #\n\n## Bash Action\n* Signature: Bash(code=\"shell_command\")\n* Description: This action string will execute a valid shell command in the `code` field. Only non-interactive commands are supported. Commands like \"vim\" and viewing images directly (e.g., using \"display\") are not allowed.\n* Example: Bash(code=\"ls -l\")\n\n## Python Action\n* Signature: Python(file_path=\"path/to/python_file\"):\n```python\nexecutable_python_code\n```\n* Description: This action will create a python file in the field `file_path` with the content wrapped by paired ``` symbols. If the file already exists, it will be overwritten. After creating the file, the python file will be executed. \n* Example: Python(file_path=\"./hello_world.py\"):\n```python\nprint(\"Hello, world!\")\n```\n\n## SQL Action\n* Signature: SQL(file_path=\"path/to/database_file\", command=\"sql_command\", output=\"path/to/output_file.csv\" or \"direct\")\n* Description: Executes an SQL command on the specified database file. If `output` is set to a file path, the results are saved to this CSV file; if set to 'direct', results are displayed directly.\n* Constraints:\n  - The database file must be accessible and in a format compatible with SQLite (e.g., .sqlite, .db).\n  - SQL commands must be valid and safely formatted to prevent security issues such as SQL injection.\n* Examples:\n  - Example1: SQL(file_path=\"data.sqlite\", command=\"SELECT name FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='table'\", output=\"directly\")\n  - Example2: SQL(file_path=\"data.db\", command=\"SELECT * FROM users\", output=\"users_output.csv\")\n\n## Terminate Action\n* Signature: Terminate(output=\"literal_answer_or_output_path\")\n* Description: This action denotes the completion of the entire task and returns the final answer or the output file/folder path. Make sure the output file is located in the initial workspace directory.\n* Examples:\n  - Example1: Terminate(output=\"New York\")\n  - Example2: Terminate(output=\"result.csv\")\n  - Example3: Terminate(output=\"FAIL\")\n\n\n# NOTICE #\n1. You need to fully understand the action space and its arguments before using it.\n2. You should first understand the environment and conduct data analysis on the given data before handling the task.\n3. You can't take some problems for granted. For example, you should check the existence of files before reading them.\n4. If the function execution fails, you should analyze the error and try to solve it.\n5. For challenging tasks like ML, you may need to verify the correctness of the method by checking the accuracy or other metrics, and try to optimize the method.\n6. Before finishing the task, ensure all instructions are met and verify the existence and correctness of any generated files.\n\n# RESPONSE FROMAT # \nFor each task input, your response should contain:\n1.

How far have we come from this initial competition? With an updated dataset and light years of new ideas we hope to see if we can get to the latest in automated grading to provide a real impact to overtaxed teachers who continue to have challenges with providing timely feedback, especially in underserved communities.** **\n\nThe goal of this competition is to train a model to score student essays. Your efforts are needed to reduce the high expense and time required to hand grade these essays. Reliable automated techniques could allow essays to be introduced in testing, a key indicator of student learning that is currently commonly avoided due to the challenges in grading.\n\nStart\n\n2 months ago\n\n###### Close\n\na month to go\n\nMerger & Entry\n\n### Description\n\nlink\n\nkeyboard_arrow_up\n\nEssay writing is an important method to evaluate student learning and performance. It is also time-consuming for educators to grade by hand. Automated Writing Evaluation (AWE) systems can score essays to supplement an educator\u2019s other efforts. AWEs also allow students to receive regular and timely feedback on their writing. However, due to their costs, many advancements in the field are not widely available to students and educators. Open-source solutions to assess student writing are needed to reach every community with these important educational tools.\nPrevious efforts to develop open-source AWEs have been limited by small datasets that were not nationally diverse or focused on common essay formats. The first Automated Essay Scoring competition scored student-written short-answer responses, however, this is a writing task not often used in the classroom. To improve upon earlier efforts, a more expansive dataset that includes high-quality, realistic classroom writing samples was required. Further, to broaden the impact, the dataset should include samples across economic and location populations to mitigate the potential of algorithmic bias.\nIn this competition, you will work with the largest open-access writing dataset aligned to current standards for student-appropriate assessments. Can you help produce an open-source essay scoring algorithm that improves upon the original** **[Automated Student Assessment Prize (ASAP)](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/asap-aes/overview) competition hosted in 2012?** **\nCompetition host Vanderbilt University is a private research university in Nashville, Tennessee.

On average,an American spends about thirty-five to fourty dollars on gas per fill-up and one hundred to two hundred dollars a month on insurance a month depending on age,experience,accidents,etc. By limiting your car usage comletely or even just a little just imagine the extra money you'll have aying around for the nessecities and maybe even a ittle you-time. Say you buy a bike and the only time you use your car is to drive to work and anywhere out-of-state,that means that you'll be able to go a week with roughly two gallons of gas. That puts you at about thirty-eight hundred dollars a year where if you were purchasing four or five gallons a week you'd be spending approximately eleven thousand dollars a year. Thats no chump change. You're insurance would gradually decrease due to safe driving and age so along with gas being cheaper,so would the insurance.\n\nFlorida is a state well-known for car crashes due to weather conditions like rain and fog and you can't do anything to change that other than take a different,much safer mode of transportaion such as a bus. Nowadays bus and semi-truck drivers are more experienced and cautius then they used to for one reason,CYB(Cover your Butt).You see major bus and semi-truck companies now that due to the size of their vehicles,if there's ever crash involving one of their autmobiles then they're likely to get blamed cause of the size of the vehicles and so it would make since for them to send their drivers to extensive training and make sure that their trucks are in good hands,which is exactly what they do. Studies show that you're chances of being in a wreck in a bus are one of every one hundred rides while being in a car driven by yourself puts you at a whopping one of ten ridesyur chances of safety are greatly increased.\n\nThe United States of America has no shortage of pollution and that's not helped by the fact that we have one of the largest populations of personal automobiles inhabiting this country. There are many other kinds of pollution that occurrs in the land of the free but most of it like factory smoke,large ship(boat)smoke and even resturant made smoke can not really be stopped or diminished by you or me but one form of pollution we can prevent is automobile smoke. In the US up to fifty percent of greenhouse gas is from cars(certain areas).If you stop using you car and ride a bike even thugh it won't seem like muchyou'd be suprised at the difference.
