  "system_message": "# CONTEXT #\nYou are a data scientist proficient in analyzing data. You excel at using Bash commands and Python code to solve data-related problems. You are working in a Bash environment with all necessary Python libraries installed. If you need to install additional libraries, you can use the 'pip install' command. You are starting in the /workspace directory, which contains all the data needed for your tasks. You can only use the actions provided in the ACTION SPACE to solve the task. The maximum number of steps you can take is 20.\n\n# ACTION SPACE #\n\n## Bash Action\n* Signature: Bash(code=\"shell_command\")\n* Description: This action string will execute a valid shell command in the `code` field. Only non-interactive commands are supported. Commands like \"vim\" and viewing images directly (e.g., using \"display\") are not allowed.\n* Example: Bash(code=\"ls -l\")\n\n## Python Action\n* Signature: Python(file_path=\"path/to/python_file\"):\n```python\nexecutable_python_code\n```\n* Description: This action will create a python file in the field `file_path` with the content wrapped by paired ``` symbols. If the file already exists, it will be overwritten. After creating the file, the python file will be executed. \n* Example: Python(file_path=\"./hello_world.py\"):\n```python\nprint(\"Hello, world!\")\n```\n\n## SQL Action\n* Signature: SQL(file_path=\"path/to/database_file\", command=\"sql_command\", output=\"path/to/output_file.csv\" or \"direct\")\n* Description: Executes an SQL command on the specified database file. If `output` is set to a file path, the results are saved to this CSV file; if set to 'direct', results are displayed directly.\n* Constraints:\n  - The database file must be accessible and in a format compatible with SQLite (e.g., .sqlite, .db).\n  - SQL commands must be valid and safely formatted to prevent security issues such as SQL injection.\n* Examples:\n  - Example1: SQL(file_path=\"data.sqlite\", command=\"SELECT name FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='table'\", output=\"directly\")\n  - Example2: SQL(file_path=\"data.db\", command=\"SELECT * FROM users\", output=\"users_output.csv\")\n\n## Terminate Action\n* Signature: Terminate(output=\"literal_answer_or_output_path\")\n* Description: This action denotes the completion of the entire task and returns the final answer or the output file/folder path. Make sure the output file is located in the initial workspace directory.\n* Examples:\n  - Example1: Terminate(output=\"New York\")\n  - Example2: Terminate(output=\"result.csv\")\n  - Example3: Terminate(output=\"FAIL\")\n\n\n# NOTICE #\n1. You need to fully understand the action space and its arguments before using it.\n2. You should first understand the environment and conduct data analysis on the given data before handling the task.\n3. You can't take some problems for granted. For example, you should check the existence of files before reading them.\n4. If the function execution fails, you should analyze the error and try to solve it.\n5. For challenging tasks like ML, you may need to verify the correctness of the method by checking the accuracy or other metrics, and try to optimize the method.\n6. Before finishing the task, ensure all instructions are met and verify the existence and correctness of any generated files.\n\n# RESPONSE FROMAT # \nFor each task input, your response should contain:\n1. One analysis of the task and the current environment, reasoning to determine the next action (prefix \"Thought: \").\n2.

Starting off as a mission to eliminate traffic congestion in India, Yulu provides the safest commute solution through a user-friendly mobile app to enable shared, solo and sustainable commuting.\r\nYulu zones are located at all the appropriate locations (including metro stations, bus stands, office spaces, residential areas, corporate offices, etc) to make those first and last miles smooth, affordable, and convenient!\r\n\r\nYulu has recently suffered considerable dips in its revenues. They have contracted a consulting company to understand the factors on which the demand for these shared electric cycles depends. Specifically, they want to understand the factors affecting the demand for these shared electric cycles in the Indian market.\r\n\r\n**How you can help here?**\r\n\r\nThe company wants to know:\r\n\r\nWhich variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared electric cycles in the Indian market?\r\nHow well those variables describe the electric cycle demands?\r\n\r\n**Concepts Used:**\r\n\r\nBi-Variate Analysis 2-sample t-test: testing for difference across populations ANNOVA Chi-square\r\n\r\n**How to begin:**\r\n\r\nImport the dataset and do usual exploratory data analysis steps like checking the structure & characteristics of the dataset\r\n\r\nTry establishing a relation between the dependent and independent variable (Dependent \u201cCount\u201d & Independent: Workingday, Weather, Season etc)\r\n\r\nSelect an appropriate test to check whether:\r\n\r\nWorking Day has effect on number of electric cycles rented\r\n\r\nNo. of cycles rented similar or different in different seasons\r\n\r\nNo. of cycles rented similar or different in different weather\r\n\r\nWeather is dependent on season (check between 2 predictor variable)\r\n\r\nSet up Null Hypothesis (H0) State the alternate hypothesis (H1) Check assumptions of the test (Normality, Equal Variance). You can check it using Histogram, Q-Q plot or statistical methods like levene\u2019s test, Shapiro-wilk test (optional)\r\n\r\nPlease continue doing the analysis even If some assumptions fail (levene\u2019s test or Shapiro-wilk test) but double check using visual analysis and report wherever necessary\r\n\r\nSet a significance level (alpha) Calculate test Statistics.

The test returns a t-statistic and p-value. A p-value less than 0.05 indicates that the data does not follow a normal distribution.\n`ntA` and `ntB` indicate whether group A and group B follow a normal distribution, respectively.\n\n**Homogeneity of Variances Test (Parametric Test):**\n\nIf the data of both groups are normally distributed, the Levene test is performed to check if the variances of the two groups are equal.\nBased on the result of the Levene test, the appropriate t-test is chosen: a standard t-test if the variances are equal, or Welch's t-test if the variances are unequal.\n\n**Non-Parametric Test:**\n\nIf either group does not follow a normal distribution, the Mann-Whitney U test is used. This is a non-parametric test.\n\n**Result Generation:**\n\nA dataframe containing the test results is generated, including whether to reject the null hypothesis, the p-value, the type of test (parametric or non-parametric), and comments.\n\n\nIf the p-value > 0.05, fail to reject the null hypothesis; if the p-value < 0.05, reject the null hypothesis.\nThe results should be filled in the corresponding `ab_test_results.csv` file.\n\nCSV output requirements:\n- **test_type**: The type of statistical test used, classified into \"Parametric\" and \"Non Parametric\".\n- **AB Hypothesis**: Whether to reject the null hypothesis, with values \"Strong Evidence To Reject NULL Hypothesis\" or \"No Evidence To Reject NULL Hypothesis\".\n- **P-Value**: The p-value of the test result.\n- **Comment**: Comments on the results, with values \"A/B Groups Are Similar\" or \"A/B Groups Are Not Similar\".",
