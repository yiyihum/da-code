  "system_message": "# CONTEXT #\nYou are a data scientist proficient in analyzing data. You excel at using Bash commands and Python code to solve data-related problems. You are working in a Bash environment with all necessary Python libraries installed. If you need to install additional libraries, you can use the 'pip install' command. You are starting in the /workspace directory, which contains all the data needed for your tasks. You can only use the actions provided in the ACTION SPACE to solve the task. The maximum number of steps you can take is 20.\n\n# ACTION SPACE #\n\n## Bash Action\n* Signature: Bash(code=\"shell_command\")\n* Description: This action string will execute a valid shell command in the `code` field. Only non-interactive commands are supported. Commands like \"vim\" and viewing images directly (e.g., using \"display\") are not allowed.\n* Example: Bash(code=\"ls -l\")\n\n## Python Action\n* Signature: Python(file_path=\"path/to/python_file\"):\n```python\nexecutable_python_code\n```\n* Description: This action will create a python file in the field `file_path` with the content wrapped by paired ``` symbols. If the file already exists, it will be overwritten. After creating the file, the python file will be executed. \n* Example: Python(file_path=\"./hello_world.py\"):\n```python\nprint(\"Hello, world!\")\n```\n\n## SQL Action\n* Signature: SQL(file_path=\"path/to/database_file\", command=\"sql_command\", output=\"path/to/output_file.csv\" or \"direct\")\n* Description: Executes an SQL command on the specified database file. If `output` is set to a file path, the results are saved to this CSV file; if set to 'direct', results are displayed directly.\n* Constraints:\n  - The database file must be accessible and in a format compatible with SQLite (e.g., .sqlite, .db).\n  - SQL commands must be valid and safely formatted to prevent security issues such as SQL injection.\n* Examples:\n  - Example1: SQL(file_path=\"data.sqlite\", command=\"SELECT name FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='table'\", output=\"directly\")\n  - Example2: SQL(file_path=\"data.db\", command=\"SELECT * FROM users\", output=\"users_output.csv\")\n\n## Terminate Action\n* Signature: Terminate(output=\"literal_answer_or_output_path\")\n* Description: This action denotes the completion of the entire task and returns the final answer or the output file/folder path. Make sure the output file is located in the initial workspace directory.\n* Examples:\n  - Example1: Terminate(output=\"New York\")\n  - Example2: Terminate(output=\"result.csv\")\n  - Example3: Terminate(output=\"FAIL\")\n\n\n# NOTICE #\n1. You need to fully understand the action space and its arguments before using it.\n2. You should first understand the environment and conduct data analysis on the given data before handling the task.\n3. You can't take some problems for granted. For example, you should check the existence of files before reading them.\n4. If the function execution fails, you should analyze the error and try to solve it.\n5. For challenging tasks like ML, you may need to verify the correctness of the method by checking the accuracy or other metrics, and try to optimize the method.\n6. Before finishing the task, ensure all instructions are met and verify the existence and correctness of any generated files.\n\n# RESPONSE FROMAT # \nFor each task input, your response should contain:\n1. One analysis of the task and the current environment, reasoning to determine the next action (prefix \"Thought: \").\n2.

The data was collected with the goal of providing users with information that could help them make informed decisions about when and where to purchase flight tickets. By analyzing patterns in flight fares over time, users can identify the best times to book tickets and potentially save money.\n\n**Sources:**\n\n1. Data collected using Python script with Beautiful Soup and Selenium libraries.\n2. Script collected data on various flight details such as Date of booking, Date of travel, Airline and class, Departure time and source, Arrival time and destination, Duration, Total stops, Price.\n3. The scraping process was designed to collect data for flights departing from a specific set of airports (Top 7 busiest airports in India).\n   Note that the Departure Time feature also includes the Source airport, and the Arrival Time feature also includes the Destination airport. Which is later extracted in Cleaned_dataset. Also both cleaned and scraped datasets have provided so that one can use dataset as per their requirement and convenience.\n\n**Inspiration:**\n\n1. Dataset created to provide users with valuable resource for analyzing flight fares in India.\n2. Detailed information on flight fares over time can be used to develop more accurate pricing models and inform users about best times to book tickets.\n3. Data can also be used to study trends and patterns in the travel industry through air can act as a valuable resource for researchers and analysts.\n\n**Limitations:**\n\n1. This dataset only covers flights departing from specific airports and limited to a certain time period.\n2. To perform time series analysis one have gather data for at least top 10 busiest airports for 365 days.\n3. This does not cover variations in aviation fuel prices as this is the one of influencing factor for deciding fare, hence the same dataset might not be useful for next year, but I will try to update it twice in an year.\n4. Also demand and supply for the particular flight seat is not available in the dataset as this data is not publicly available on any flight booking web site.\n\n**Scope of Improvement:**\n\n1. The dataset could be enhanced by including additional features such as current aviation fuel prices and the distance between the source and destination in terms of longitude and latitude.\n2. The data could also be expanded to include more airlines and more airports, providing a more comprehensive view of the flight market.\n3. Additionally, it may be helpful to include data on flight cancellations, delays, and other factors that can impact the price and availability of flights.\n4. Finally, while the current dataset provides information on flight prices, it does not include information on the quality of the flight experience, such as legroom, in-flight amenities, and customer reviews. Including this type of data could provide a more comple\n[Observation too long, truncated; Try other commands to get the left part.]",
