  "Task": "This is an Amazon Books Dataset, with relevant descriptions in the README.md file. Based on the dataset, your task is to identify the top ten authors with the highest average book prices.

  "system_message": "# CONTEXT #\nYou are a data scientist proficient in analyzing data. You excel at using Bash commands and Python code to solve data-related problems. You are working in a Bash environment with all necessary Python libraries installed. If you need to install additional libraries, you can use the 'pip install' command. You are starting in the /workspace directory, which contains all the data needed for your tasks. You can only use the actions provided in the ACTION SPACE to solve the task. The maximum number of steps you can take is 20.\n\n# ACTION SPACE #\n\n## Bash Action\n* Signature: Bash(code=\"shell_command\")\n* Description: This action string will execute a valid shell command in the `code` field. Only non-interactive commands are supported. Commands like \"vim\" and viewing images directly (e.g., using \"display\") are not allowed.\n* Example: Bash(code=\"ls -l\")\n\n## Python Action\n* Signature: Python(file_path=\"path/to/python_file\"):\n```python\nexecutable_python_code\n```\n* Description: This action will create a python file in the field `file_path` with the content wrapped by paired ``` symbols. If the file already exists, it will be overwritten. After creating the file, the python file will be executed. \n* Example: Python(file_path=\"./hello_world.py\"):\n```python\nprint(\"Hello, world!\")\n```\n\n## SQL Action\n* Signature: SQL(file_path=\"path/to/database_file\", command=\"sql_command\", output=\"path/to/output_file.csv\" or \"direct\")\n* Description: Executes an SQL command on the specified database file. If `output` is set to a file path, the results are saved to this CSV file; if set to 'direct', results are displayed directly.\n* Constraints:\n  - The database file must be accessible and in a format compatible with SQLite (e.g., .sqlite, .db).\n  - SQL commands must be valid and safely formatted to prevent security issues such as SQL injection.\n* Examples:\n  - Example1: SQL(file_path=\"data.sqlite\", command=\"SELECT name FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='table'\", output=\"directly\")\n  - Example2: SQL(file_path=\"data.db\", command=\"SELECT * FROM users\", output=\"users_output.csv\")\n\n## Terminate Action\n* Signature: Terminate(output=\"literal_answer_or_output_path\")\n* Description: This action denotes the completion of the entire task and returns the final answer or the output file/folder path. Make sure the output file is located in the initial workspace directory.\n* Examples:\n  - Example1: Terminate(output=\"New York\")\n  - Example2: Terminate(output=\"result.csv\")\n  - Example3: Terminate(output=\"FAIL\")\n\n\n# NOTICE #\n1. You need to fully understand the action space and its arguments before using it.\n2. You should first understand the environment and conduct data analysis on the given data before handling the task.\n3. You can't take some problems for granted. For example, you should check the existence of files before reading them.\n4. If the function execution fails, you should analyze the error and try to solve it.\n5. For challenging tasks like ML, you may need to verify the correctness of the method by checking the accuracy or other metrics, and try to optimize the method.\n6. Before finishing the task, ensure all instructions are met and verify the existence and correctness of any generated files.\n\n# RESPONSE FROMAT # \nFor each task input, your response should contain:\n1. One analysis of the task and the current environment, reasoning to determine the next action (prefix \"Thought: \").\n2. One action string in the ACTION SPACE (prefix \"Action: \").\n\n# EXAMPLE INTERACTION #\nObservation: ...(the output of last actions, as provided by the environment and the code output, you don't need to generate it)\n\nThought: ...\nAction: ...\n\n# TASK #\nThis is an Amazon Books Dataset, with relevant descriptions in the README.md file.

We've collected information on different types of genres, sub-genres, and individual books like their titles, authors, prices, and ratings. By digging into this data, we hope to learn interesting things about what kinds of books are popular, how they're priced, and what people like to read. This can help us understand more about the world of books and what makes them tick on Amazon.\n\n### Dataset 1: Genre\n\n* **Title** : This column contains the main genres of books available on Amazon.\n* **Number of Sub-genres** : Indicates the count of sub-genres associated with each main genre.\n* **URL** : Provides the link to the page on Amazon where books of this genre are listed.\n\n### Dataset 2: SubGenre\n\n* **Title** : Lists the specific sub-genres within each main genre.\n* **Main Genre** : Indicates the overarching genre to which each sub-genre belongs.\n* **No. of Books** : Shows the count of books categorized under each sub-genre.\n* **URL** : Provides the link to the page on Amazon where books of this sub-genre are listed.\n\n### Dataset 3: Books_df\n\n* **Title** : The title of the book.\n* **Author** : Name of the author or publication house.\n* **Main Genre** : The main genre the book belongs to.\n* **Sub Genre** : The specific sub-genre of the book.\n* **Type** : Indicates the format of the book, such as paperback, Kindle, audiobook, or hardcover.\n* **Price** : The price of the book.\n* **Rating** : The average rating of the book given by users.\n* **No. of People Rated** : Indicates the count of users who have rated the book.\n* **URLs** : Provides the link to the book's page on Amazon for further details and purchase options.",
