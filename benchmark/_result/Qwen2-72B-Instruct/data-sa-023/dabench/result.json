  "system_message": "# CONTEXT #\nYou are a data scientist proficient in analyzing data. You excel at using Bash commands and Python code to solve data-related problems. You are working in a Bash environment with all necessary Python libraries installed. If you need to install additional libraries, you can use the 'pip install' command. You are starting in the /workspace directory, which contains all the data needed for your tasks. You can only use the actions provided in the ACTION SPACE to solve the task. The maximum number of steps you can take is 20.\n\n# ACTION SPACE #\n\n## Bash Action\n* Signature: Bash(code=\"shell_command\")\n* Description: This action string will execute a valid shell command in the `code` field. Only non-interactive commands are supported. Commands like \"vim\" and viewing images directly (e.g., using \"display\") are not allowed.\n* Example: Bash(code=\"ls -l\")\n\n## Python Action\n* Signature: Python(file_path=\"path/to/python_file\"):\n```python\nexecutable_python_code\n```\n* Description: This action will create a python file in the field `file_path` with the content wrapped by paired ``` symbols. If the file already exists, it will be overwritten. After creating the file, the python file will be executed. \n* Example: Python(file_path=\"./hello_world.py\"):\n```python\nprint(\"Hello, world!\")\n```\n\n## SQL Action\n* Signature: SQL(file_path=\"path/to/database_file\", command=\"sql_command\", output=\"path/to/output_file.csv\" or \"direct\")\n* Description: Executes an SQL command on the specified database file. If `output` is set to a file path, the results are saved to this CSV file; if set to 'direct', results are displayed directly.\n* Constraints:\n  - The database file must be accessible and in a format compatible with SQLite (e.g., .sqlite, .db).\n  - SQL commands must be valid and safely formatted to prevent security issues such as SQL injection.\n* Examples:\n  - Example1: SQL(file_path=\"data.sqlite\", command=\"SELECT name FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='table'\", output=\"directly\")\n  - Example2: SQL(file_path=\"data.db\", command=\"SELECT * FROM users\", output=\"users_output.csv\")\n\n## Terminate Action\n* Signature: Terminate(output=\"literal_answer_or_output_path\")\n* Description: This action denotes the completion of the entire task and returns the final answer or the output file/folder path. Make sure the output file is located in the initial workspace directory.\n* Examples:\n  - Example1: Terminate(output=\"New York\")\n  - Example2: Terminate(output=\"result.csv\")\n  - Example3: Terminate(output=\"FAIL\")\n\n\n# NOTICE #\n1. You need to fully understand the action space and its arguments before using it.\n2. You should first understand the environment and conduct data analysis on the given data before handling the task.\n3. You can't take some problems for granted. For example, you should check the existence of files before reading them.\n4. If the function execution fails, you should analyze the error and try to solve it.\n5. For challenging tasks like ML, you may need to verify the correctness of the method by checking the accuracy or other metrics, and try to optimize the method.\n6. Before finishing the task, ensure all instructions are met and verify the existence and correctness of any generated files.\n\n# RESPONSE FROMAT # \nFor each task input, your response should contain:\n1. One analysis of the task and the current environment, reasoning to determine the next action (prefix \"Thought: \").\n2. One action string in the ACTION SPACE (prefix \"Action: \").\n\n# EXAMPLE INTERACTION #\nObservation: ...(the output of last actions, as provided by the environment and the code output, you don't need to generate it)\n\nThought: ...\nAction: ...\n\n# TASK #\nYou have a Quantitative Risk Management dataset, with relevant descriptions provided in the README.md file. Based on the descriptions in epochs_description.txt, you need to calculate and save efficient covariance matrices of a portfolio over different time periods. Please save the results in the format provided by template.csv to \"{epoch}_covariance.csv\", where the epochs are \"before\", \"during\", and \"after\".\n",

It is marked by significant economic growth and expansion in the financial markets. \n   *Note: Analysts observed increased market volatility during this time.*\n\n2. **During (1-1-2007 to 31-12-2008)**:\n   This epoch spans the height of the global financial crisis. The markets experienced extreme volatility, and many financial institutions faced unprecedented challenges.\n   *Note: This period saw a dramatic increase in risk and correlation among assets.*\n\n3. **After (1-1-2009 to 31-12-2010)**:\n   This period covers the initial recovery phase following the financial crisis. Markets began to stabilize, and economic policies aimed at recovery were implemented.\n   *Note: The recovery phase was characterized by gradual improvement in market conditions.*\n\n## Additional Observations:\n\n- **Market Trends**: Throughout these epochs, various market trends and external factors influenced asset performance and correlation.\n- **Economic Policies**: Different economic policies enacted during and after the crisis had significant impacts on market behavior.\n- **Global Events**: Events such as political changes, natural disasters, and technological advancements also played roles in shaping the market dynamics.\n\n*For a detailed analysis, please refer to the individual covariance matrices saved as CSV files for each epoch.*\n\n## Additional Notes:\n- Data integrity checks were performed to ensure accuracy.\n- Unexpected outliers were identified and addressed accordingly.\n- Comprehensive risk assessments were conducted for each period.\n- Further analysis recommended for portfolio optimization strategies.",
