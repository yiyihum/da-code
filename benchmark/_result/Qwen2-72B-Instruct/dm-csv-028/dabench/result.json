  "Task": "This is a Sales Data dataset, with detailed descriptions provided in the README.md file.

  "system_message": "# CONTEXT #\nYou are a data scientist proficient in analyzing data. You excel at using Bash commands and Python code to solve data-related problems. You are working in a Bash environment with all necessary Python libraries installed. If you need to install additional libraries, you can use the 'pip install' command. You are starting in the /workspace directory, which contains all the data needed for your tasks. You can only use the actions provided in the ACTION SPACE to solve the task. The maximum number of steps you can take is 20.\n\n# ACTION SPACE #\n\n## Bash Action\n* Signature: Bash(code=\"shell_command\")\n* Description: This action string will execute a valid shell command in the `code` field. Only non-interactive commands are supported. Commands like \"vim\" and viewing images directly (e.g., using \"display\") are not allowed.\n* Example: Bash(code=\"ls -l\")\n\n## Python Action\n* Signature: Python(file_path=\"path/to/python_file\"):\n```python\nexecutable_python_code\n```\n* Description: This action will create a python file in the field `file_path` with the content wrapped by paired ``` symbols. If the file already exists, it will be overwritten. After creating the file, the python file will be executed. \n* Example: Python(file_path=\"./hello_world.py\"):\n```python\nprint(\"Hello, world!\")\n```\n\n## SQL Action\n* Signature: SQL(file_path=\"path/to/database_file\", command=\"sql_command\", output=\"path/to/output_file.csv\" or \"direct\")\n* Description: Executes an SQL command on the specified database file. If `output` is set to a file path, the results are saved to this CSV file; if set to 'direct', results are displayed directly.\n* Constraints:\n  - The database file must be accessible and in a format compatible with SQLite (e.g., .sqlite, .db).\n  - SQL commands must be valid and safely formatted to prevent security issues such as SQL injection.\n* Examples:\n  - Example1: SQL(file_path=\"data.sqlite\", command=\"SELECT name FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='table'\", output=\"directly\")\n  - Example2: SQL(file_path=\"data.db\", command=\"SELECT * FROM users\", output=\"users_output.csv\")\n\n## Terminate Action\n* Signature: Terminate(output=\"literal_answer_or_output_path\")\n* Description: This action denotes the completion of the entire task and returns the final answer or the output file/folder path. Make sure the output file is located in the initial workspace directory.\n* Examples:\n  - Example1: Terminate(output=\"New York\")\n  - Example2: Terminate(output=\"result.csv\")\n  - Example3: Terminate(output=\"FAIL\")\n\n\n# NOTICE #\n1. You need to fully understand the action space and its arguments before using it.\n2. You should first understand the environment and conduct data analysis on the given data before handling the task.\n3. You can't take some problems for granted. For example, you should check the existence of files before reading them.\n4. If the function execution fails, you should analyze the error and try to solve it.\n5. For challenging tasks like ML, you may need to verify the correctness of the method by checking the accuracy or other metrics, and try to optimize the method.\n6. Before finishing the task, ensure all instructions are met and verify the existence and correctness of any generated files.\n\n# RESPONSE FROMAT # \nFor each task input, your response should contain:\n1. One analysis of the task and the current environment, reasoning to determine the next action (prefix \"Thought: \").\n2. One action string in the ACTION SPACE (prefix \"Action: \").\n\n# EXAMPLE INTERACTION #\nObservation: ...(the output of last actions, as provided by the environment and the code output, you don't need to generate it)\n\nThought: ...\nAction: ...\n\n# TASK #\nThis is a Sales Data dataset, with detailed descriptions provided in the README.md file. Your task is to calculate the total profit for each state by subtracting cost from revenue, sort the profits in descending order, and write the results into the state_profit.csv file using the provided template.\n",

Year: This column represents the year in which the transaction occurred. It could be used to track trends over time or to filter the data based on a specific year or range of years.\n2. Month: This column represents the month in which the transaction occurred. It could be used to track trends over time or to filter the data based on a specific month or range of months.\n3. Customer Age: This column represents the age of the customer. It could be used to segment customers based on age ranges or to analyze the purchasing behavior of different age groups.\n4. Customer Gender: This column represents the gender of the customer. It could be used to segment customers based on gender or to analyze the purchasing behavior of different genders.\n5. Country: This column represents the country where the transaction occurred. It could be used to analyze sales by country or to filter the data based on a specific country or range of countries.\n6. State: This column represents the state where the transaction occurred. It could be used to analyze sales by the state or to filter the data based on a specific state or range of states.\n7. Product Category: This column represents the broad category of the product sold. It could be used to analyze sales by product category or to filter the data based on a specific product category.\n8. Sub Category: This column represents the specific subcategory of the product sold. It could be used to analyze sales by subcategory or to filter the data based on a specific subcategory.\n9. Quantity: This column represents the quantity of the product sold. It could be used to analyze sales volume or to calculate the total revenue generated from a particular product or product category.\n10. Unit Cost: This column represents the cost of producing or acquiring one unit of the product. It could be used to calculate profit margins or to compare the costs of different products or product categories.\n11. Unit Price: This column represents the price at which one unit of the product was sold. It could be us\n[Observation too long, truncated; Try other commands to get the left part.]",
