This code snippet is used to perform a Bootstrap analysis to compare the mean beak sizes between two time points (1975 and 2012). 

Compute the mean of the combined dataset: Calculate the mean of the beak size data sets for 1975 and 2012, and then determine the mean of the combined dataset

1. Shift the samples: Shift the 1975 and 2012 data sets by adjusting their means to match the mean of the combined dataset, resulting in shifted data sets
2. Get Bootstrap replicates of shifted data sets: Perform Bootstrap resampling on the shifted data sets to calculate the mean of each resampled dataset. Repeat this process 10,000 times to obtain the distribution of Bootstrap resampled means, setting random seed as 42
3. Compute replicates of the difference of means: Calculate the difference between Bootstrap replicates of means for 2012 and 1975
4. Compute the p-value: Calculate the p-value by determining the proportion of bs_diff_replicates that are greater than or equal to the actual difference in means

This process utilizes Bootstrap analysis to assess whether there is a significant difference in beak sizes between 1975 and 2012.
