Unfortunately, you do not have Frog E's impact forces available, but you know they have a mean of 0.55 N. Because you don't have the original data of Frog E, you cannot do a permutation test, and you cannot assess the hypothesis that the forces from Frog D and Frog E come from the same distribution. You will therefore test another, less restrictive hypothesis: The mean strike force of Frog D is equal to that of Frog E.

To set up the bootstrap hypothesis test, you will take the mean as our test statistic. Remember, your goal is to calculate the probability of getting a mean impact force less than or equal to what was observed for Frog D if the hypothesis that the true mean of Frog D's impact forces is equal to that of Frog E is true. You first translate all of the data of Frog D such that the mean is 0.55 N. This involves adding the mean force of Frog E and subtracting the mean force of Frog D from each measurement of Frog D. This leaves other properties of Frog D's distribution, such as the variance, unchanged.

Notice that you should take at least 10,000 bootstrap replicates of the mean of your translated forces.

Compute the p-value by finding the fraction of your bootstrap replicates that are less than the observed mean impact force of Frog D.
