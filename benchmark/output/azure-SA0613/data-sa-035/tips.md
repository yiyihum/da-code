
The Fama-French model can be represented as:

R_P=RF+\beta_M(R_M-RF)+b_{SMB}+B_{HML}\cdot HML+\alpha

Where:
SMB: The small minus big factor
b_{SMB}: Exposure to the SMB factor
HML: The high minus low factor
b_{HML}: Exposure to the HML factor
α: Performance which is unexplained by any other factors
β_M: Beta to the broad market portfolio B
