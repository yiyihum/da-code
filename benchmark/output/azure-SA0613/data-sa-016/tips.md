investigate a polynomial of the form:

$$ \prod_{i=1}^{m} (1 + t^{(2i + 1)^2}) $$


and verify that the distribution of its coefficients conforms to a normal distribution up to a certain precision.

That polynomial is Poincare polynomial (generating function for dimension of the cohomologies) for the $\mathit{SU}(m)$ group. 
SymPy is employed to obtain the coefficients, and subsequently, write the coefficients and the fitted normal distribution values to a CSV file. 
start_degree = 10
end_degree = 20
step = 5
Here's a brief explanation of the columns in the CSV file:

Degree: The degree of each term in the polynomial.
Coefficient: The coefficient of the polynomial for the corresponding degree.
Fitted_Normal_PDF: The value of the normal distribution's PDF at the corresponding degree, fitted to match the distribution of the polynomial coefficients.

### Columns

The CSV file consists of two columns:

1. **t_value**: This column represents the \( t \) values at which the polynomial is evaluated. These values range from \(-10\) to \(10\), inclusive, with 100 equally spaced points.

2. **polynomial_value**: This column contains the corresponding values of the polynomial \( P(t) \) evaluated at each \( t \) value.

### Sample Data

The first few rows of the file look like this:

| t_value | polynomial_value |
|---------|------------------|
| -10.0   | ...              |
| -9.8    | ...              |
| -9.6    | ...              |
| -9.4    | ...              |
| ...     | ...              |

### Usage

This file can be used for various purposes, such as:

- **Visualization**: Plotting the polynomial values against \( t \) values to understand the polynomial's behavior.
- **Analysis**: Studying the properties of the polynomial and how it changes with different \( t \) values.
- **Educational**: Demonstrating the process of polynomial generation and evaluation in a mathematical or programming context.


This introduction should provide a clear understanding of the contents and purpose of the `polynomial_values.csv` file.
