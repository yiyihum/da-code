#### Briefly

The project is devoted to interaction between machine learning methods and finite group/graph theory (tasks like: estimate diameter, find short path, etc).
Partly motivated by the Kaggle challenge "Santa23" :** **[https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/santa-2023](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/santa-2023)
but much more broad.** **

#### Main goals:

1. Develop machine learning methods to find short paths on Cayley graphs of arbitrary finite groups. (It is direct generalization of the Kaggle Santa23 challenge).
2. Machine learning methods to estimate diameter of the Caley graphs for finite groups. And also growth.
3. Develop mathematical based benchmarks for graph embedding packages - taking into account: distortion of graph metric under embedding, symmetry preservation, distance distribution preservations, comparing with example gallery, …** **

Other goals include:

Study random walks on Cayley graphs, machine learning methods for** **[Lovász conjecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lov%C3%A1sz_conjecture) on existence of Hamiltonian paths on Cayley graphs , ……..
