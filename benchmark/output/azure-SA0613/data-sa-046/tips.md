This task calculates the length-to-depth ratios for two different years (1975 and 2012), computes the mean ratio for each year, generates 10,000 bootstrap replicates of the means of the ratios, calculates the 99% confidence intervals for each year, and prints the results.

The random seed for the resampling is set to 42 to ensure reproducibility of the results.

The code essentially performs the following steps:

1. Compute the length-to-depth ratios for 1975 and 2012.
2. Calculate the mean ratio for each year.
3. Generate 10,000 bootstrap replicates of the means of the ratios.
4. Calculate the 99% confidence intervals for the bootstrap replicates of the means for each year.
5. Print the mean ratio and confidence intervals for both 1975 and 2012.

This code provides insights into the mean ratios of length-to-depth for the two different years and their respective confidence intervals.
