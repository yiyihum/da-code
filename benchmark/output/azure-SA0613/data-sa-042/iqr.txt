The Interquartile Range (IQR) method is a statistical technique used to identify and handle outliers in a dataset. The IQR is the range within which the middle 50% of the data falls, calculated as the difference between the third quartile (Q3) and the first quartile (Q1). Here's a step-by-step explanation of the IQR method:

1. **Calculate Q1 and Q3**: Identify the 25th percentile (Q1) and the 75th percentile (Q3) of the data.
2. **Calculate IQR**: Compute the IQR as Q3 - Q1.
3. **Determine the lower and upper bounds**:
   - Lower bound: Q1 - 1.5 * IQR
   - Upper bound: Q3 + 1.5 * IQR
4. **Identify outliers**: Any data points below the lower bound or above the upper bound are considered outliers.

This method is particularly useful because it is not influenced by extreme values and works well even when the data distribution is not symmetric.

Example:

Consider the following dataset: [10, 12, 14, 15, 16, 18, 19, 20, 22, 24, 30].

1. **Sort the dataset** (if not already sorted): [10, 12, 14, 15, 16, 18, 19, 20, 22, 24, 30]
2. **Calculate Q1 and Q3**:
   - Q1 = 14 (25th percentile)
   - Q3 = 22 (75th percentile)
3. **Calculate IQR**: IQR = 22 - 14 = 8
4. **Determine the bounds**:
   - Lower bound = 14 - 1.5 * 8 = 2
   - Upper bound = 22 + 1.5 * 8 = 34
5. **Identify outliers**: In this dataset, there are no values below 2 or above 34, so there are no outliers.

The IQR method is simple, robust, and effective for a wide range of datasets, especially those with outliers or non-normal distributions.
