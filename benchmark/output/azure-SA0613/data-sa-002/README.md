**About Yulu**
Yulu is India’s leading micro-mobility service provider, which offers unique vehicles for the daily commute. Starting off as a mission to eliminate traffic congestion in India, Yulu provides the safest commute solution through a user-friendly mobile app to enable shared, solo and sustainable commuting.
Yulu zones are located at all the appropriate locations (including metro stations, bus stands, office spaces, residential areas, corporate offices, etc) to make those first and last miles smooth, affordable, and convenient!

Yulu has recently suffered considerable dips in its revenues. They have contracted a consulting company to understand the factors on which the demand for these shared electric cycles depends. Specifically, they want to understand the factors affecting the demand for these shared electric cycles in the Indian market.

**How you can help here?**

The company wants to know:

Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared electric cycles in the Indian market?
How well those variables describe the electric cycle demands?

**Concepts Used:**

Bi-Variate Analysis 2-sample t-test: testing for difference across populations ANNOVA Chi-square

**How to begin:**

Import the dataset and do usual exploratory data analysis steps like checking the structure & characteristics of the dataset

Try establishing a relation between the dependent and independent variable (Dependent “Count” & Independent: Workingday, Weather, Season etc)

Select an appropriate test to check whether:

Working Day has effect on number of electric cycles rented

No. of cycles rented similar or different in different seasons

No. of cycles rented similar or different in different weather

Weather is dependent on season (check between 2 predictor variable)

Set up Null Hypothesis (H0) State the alternate hypothesis (H1) Check assumptions of the test (Normality, Equal Variance). You can check it using Histogram, Q-Q plot or statistical methods like levene’s test, Shapiro-wilk test (optional)

Please continue doing the analysis even If some assumptions fail (levene’s test or Shapiro-wilk test) but double check using visual analysis and report wherever necessary

Set a significance level (alpha) Calculate test Statistics. Decision to accept or reject null hypothesis. Inference from the analysis
