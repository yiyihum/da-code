  "system_message": "\nYou are a helpful assitant who is expert at data analysis and processing.\nNow you will interact with a Bash environment to complete a data-related task. At the beginning, you are in the /workspace folder containing resources you need to solve the task.\nTo communicate with the environment, you can only use the following actions with pre-defined formats. After parsing and executing the action, the observation from the environment will be sent to you, such that you can take the next action in an interactive manner.\nPlease make your own decisions, explore your current environment, and make best use of the resources you have.\nHere are the definitions of each action, description, usage and observation:\n\n\nAction: ExecuteCode(code=\"shell_command\")\nDescription: This action string will execute a valid shell command in the `code` field, such as `cat path/to/file.txt` and `python path/to/file.py`. Please pay attention to the current working directory. If you execute a `cd new_path` command, the working directory will be changed. If no further action is taken, the working directory will still be the changed new_path. Furthermore, for two special commands `cd new_path` and `export var=val`, they must occur as a single command and cannot use `&&` or `;` to chain together. If you want to, for example, set multiple environment variables, please use multiple ExecuteCode actions.\nUsage: ExecuteCode(code=\"ls -l\")\nObservation: The observation space is the stdout or stderr of the executed command in the bash terminal.\n\nAction: CreateFile(filepath=\"path/to/file\"):\n```\nfile_content\n```\nDescription: This action will create a file in the field `filepath` with the content wrapped by paired ``` symbols. Notice that, the file content can be free form text, arbitrary programming langugage codes or configurations. For more structured format (e.g., .csv or .json files), you can use the CreateFile action to firstly create a writing-to-file program file (e.g., .py or .sh) and then use the ExecuteCode action to execute the program and generate the structured file. Remember to provide the field `filepath` besides the \"file_content\" in this action even if the created file is only temporary and will be deleted later.\nUsage: CreateFile(filepath=\"hello_world.py\"):\n```\nprint(\"Hello, world!\")\n```\nObservation: The observation space is a text message indicating whether this action is executed successfully or not.\n\nAction: EditFile(filepath=\"path/to/file\"):\n```\nfile_content\n```\nDescription: This action will edit a file in the field `filepath` with the content wrapped by paired ``` symbols. Notice that, the file content can be free form text, arbitrary programming langugage codes or configurations. Normally, you need to read a file before deciding whether to use EditFile to modify it. You need to give the entire modified file content. \nUsage: EditFile(filepath=\"hello_world.py\"):\n```\nprint(\"Hello, world!\")\n```\nObservation: The observation space is a text message indicating whether this action is executed successfully or not.\n\nAction: Terminate(output=\"literal_answer_or_output_path\")\nDescription: This action denotes the completion of the entire task and returns the final answer or the output file/folder path. If the output field is a directory or filepath, you can use the relative path of the current working directory or directly use the absolute path.\nUsage1: Terminate(output=\"New York\")\nUsage2: Terminate(output=\"/workspace/result.txt\")\nUsage3: Terminate(output=\"FAIL\")\nObservation: The observation space is empty since the task is finished.\n\n\nYour response must contain parsable Action. \nYour response at each turn must contain ONLY SINGLE ONE parsable action. When you finish the task, you must respond with a Terminate action.\n\n\nGiven the task input, your reponse at each turn should contain: 1) a thought process that reasons about the current situation (with prefix \"Thought: \"), and 2) an action string in the action space defined by the environment (with prefix \"Action: \"). Such that the interaction history is a sequence of interleaving Thought, Action and Observation steps that appear like this: (note that each step may cross multiple lines, and you do not need to generate the observation string yourself, the environment will generate it for you)\n\nThought: ...\nAction: ...\n\nObservation: ...\n\nThought: ...\nAction: ...\n\nObservation: ...\n\nNow, let's start.\n\nYou are asked to complete the following task: \nThis is a dataset for a health features and medical condition prediction competition, with the description available in README.md.

You are being asked to predict if the person has one or more of any of the three medical conditions (Class 1), or none of the three medical conditions (Class 0). You will create a model trained on measurements of health characteristics.\n\nTo determine if someone has these medical conditions requires a long and intrusive process to collect information from patients. With predictive models, we can shorten this process and keep patient details private by collecting key characteristics relative to the conditions, then encoding these characteristics.\n\nYour work will help researchers discover the relationship between measurements of certain characteristics and potential patient conditions.\n\n## Context\n\nThey say age is just a number but a whole host of health issues come with aging. From heart disease and dementia to hearing loss and arthritis, aging is a risk factor for numerous diseases and complications. The growing field of bioinformatics includes research into interventions that can help slow and reverse biological aging and prevent major age-related ailments. Data science could have a role to play in developing new methods to solve problems with diverse data, even if the number of samples is small.\n\nCurrently, models like XGBoost and random forest are used to predict medical conditions yet the models' performance is not good enough. Dealing with critical problems where lives are on the line, models need to make correct predictions reliably and consistently between different cases.\n\nFounded in 2015, competition host** **[InVitro Cell Research, LLC (ICR)](https://invitrocellresearch.com/) is a privately funded company focused on regenerative and preventive personalized medicine. Their offices and labs in the greater New York City area offer state-of-the-art research space. InVitro Cell Research's Scientists are what set them apart, helping guide and defining their mission of researching how to repair aging people fast.\n\nIn this competition, you\u2019ll work with measurements of health characteristic data to solve critical problems in bioinformatics. Based on minimal training, you\u2019ll create a model to predict if a person has any of three medical conditions, with an aim to improve on existing methods.\n\nYou could help advance the growing field of bioinformatics and explore new methods to solve complex problems with diverse data.\n\n> **This is a Code Competition. Refer to** **[Code Requirements](https://kaggle.com/competitions/icr-identify-age-related-conditions/overview/code-requirements) for details.**\n\n### Evaluation\n\nlink\n\nkeyboard_arrow_up\n\nSubmissions are evaluated using a** ** **balanced logarithmic loss** .
