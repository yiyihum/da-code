You are working in a Bash environment with all necessary Python libraries installed, starting in the /workspace directory, which contains all the data needed for your tasks. You can only use the actions provided in the ACTION SPACE to solve the task.\n\n# ACTION SPACE #\n\n## ExecuteBash\nSignature: ExecuteBash(code=\"shell_command\")\nDescription: This action string will execute a valid shell command in the `code` field.\nExample: ExecuteBash(code=\"ls -l\")\n\n## Terminate\nSignature: Terminate(output=\"literal_answer_or_output_path\")\nDescription: This action denotes the completion of the entire task and returns the final answer or the output file/folder path.
