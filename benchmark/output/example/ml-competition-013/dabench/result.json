You are working in a Bash environment with all necessary Python libraries installed, starting in the /workspace directory, which contains all the data needed for your tasks. You can only use the actions provided in the ACTION SPACE to solve the task.\n\n# ACTION SPACE #\n\n## ExecuteBash\nSignature: ExecuteBash(code=\"shell_command\")\nDescription: This action string will execute a valid shell command in the `code` field.\nExample: ExecuteBash(code=\"ls -l\")\n\n## Terminate\nSignature: Terminate(output=\"literal_answer_or_output_path\")\nDescription: This action denotes the completion of the entire task and returns the final answer or the output file/folder path. Make sure the output file is located in the initial workspace directory.\nExample1: Terminate(output=\"New York\")\nExample2: Terminate(output=\"result.txt\")\nExample3: Terminate(output=\"FAIL\")\n\n\n## ExecuteSimplePython\nSignature: `ExecuteSimplePython`\n```\nexecutable_python_code\n```\n\nDescription: This action executes a very simple Python command or snippet wrapped in paired ``` symbols. It is intended for short, exploratory code snippets. For longer or more complex code, please use CreateFile to write the code to a file and then execute it.\n\nExample: ExecuteSimplePython:\n```\nprint(\"Hello, world!\")\n```\n\n## CreateFile\nSignature: CreateFile(filepath=\"path/to/file\"):\n```\nfile_content\n```\nDescription: This action will create a file in the field `filepath` with the content wrapped by paired ``` symbols. Make sure the file content is complete and correct. If the file already exists, you can only use EditFile to modify it.\nExample: CreateFile(filepath=\"hello_world.py\"):\n```\nprint(\"Hello, world!\")\n```\n\n## EditFile\nSignature: EditFile(filepath=\"path/to/file\"):\n```\nfile_content\n```\nDescription: This action will overwrite the file specified in the filepath field with the content wrapped in paired ``` symbols. Normally, you need to read the file before deciding to use EditFile to modify it.\nExample: EditFile(filepath=\"hello_world.py\"):\n```\nprint(\"Hello, world!\")\n```\n\n\n# NOTICE #\n1. You should first understand the environment and conduct data analysis before handling the task.\n1. You need to fully understand the action space and its arguments before using it.\n2. You can't take some problems for granted. For example, what's the content in the csv files, etc. But you can try to use the action space to solve the problem.\n3. If the function execution fails, you should analyze the error and try to solve it.\n4. Before finishing the task, ensure all instructions are met and verify the existence and correctness of any generated files.\n\n# RESPONSE FROMAT # \nFor each task input, your response should contain:\n1. One analysis of the task and the current environment, reasoning to determine the next action (prefix \"Thought: \").\n2. One action string in the ACTION SPACE (prefix \"Action: \").\n3. Observation is the output of your actions, as provided by the environment and the code output, you don't need to generate it.\n\n# Example interaction # \nObservation: ...\n\nThought: ...\nAction: ...\n\n# TASK #\nThis is a dataset for a sales volume prediction competition, with the description available in README.md.

Again, these will be fairly light-weight datasets that are synthetically generated from real-world data, and will provide an opportunity to quickly iterate through various model and feature engineering ideas, create visualizations, etc.** \n\n## Evaluation\n\nlink\n\nkeyboard_arrow_up\n\nSubmissions are evaluated on** **[SMAPE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetric_mean_absolute_percentage_error) between forecasts and actual values. We define SMAPE = 0 when the actual and predicted values are both 0.\n\n## Submission File\n\nFor each** **`id` in the test set, you must predict the corresponding** **`num_sold`. The file should contain a header and have the following format:\n\n```\nid,num_sold\n136950,100\n136950,100\n136950,100\netc.\n```",
