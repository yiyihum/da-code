## About Dataset

### Context

Online retail is a transnational data set which contains all the transactions occurring between 01/12/2010 and 09/12/2011 for a UK-based and registered non-store online retail. The company mainly sells unique all-occasion gifts. Many customers of the company are wholesalers.

### Business Goal

We will be using the online retail trasnational dataset to build a RFM clustering and choose the best set of customers which the company should target.
