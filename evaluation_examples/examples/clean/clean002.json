There have been a number of complaints indicating that some New York residents have been receiving multiple parking tickets for a single violation. This is resulting in the affected residents having to incur additional legal fees for a single incident. You have been tasked with identifying records that reflect this duplication of violations. A decision has been made to use the minimum fee to resolve the ambiguity created by these duplicates.",
