Please refer to HubSpot's data documentation and SnowSQL documentation to answer the questions: What contacts and companies are due for outreach from the sales team?  Deals worth in excess of $10,000 are high value and so the sales team should be reaching out at least once per month until the deal is either won or lost. This query finds contacts associated with deals where the amount is greater than $10,000, but the contact has not had a sales outreach recently. ",
