We only considered titles which have the promotion name in the title name itself (Eg. NXT Women's Title).

We excluded some title name that consists of the phrase "title change". We did not count Money in the Bank Briefcase, King of the Ring, spot in the Royal Rumble, interim championships and Dusty Rhodes Tag Team Classic Cup as titles.

We assumed that tag team titles will have the phrase "tag team" in the title name.
