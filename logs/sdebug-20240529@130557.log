1 represents low damage
2 represents a medium amount of damage
3 represents almost complete destruction

The dataset mainly consists of information on the buildings' structure and their legal ownership. Each row in the dataset represents a specific building in the region that was hit by Gorkha earthquake.

There are 39 columns in this dataset, where the building_id column is a unique and random identifier. The remaining 38 features are described in the section below. Categorical variables have been obfuscated random lowercase ascii characters. The appearance of the same character in distinct columns does not imply the same original value.

Description

geo_level_1_id, geo_level_2_id, geo_level_3_id (type: int): geographic region in which building exists, from largest (level 1) to most specific sub-region (level 3). Possible values: level 1: 0-30, level 2: 0-1427, level 3: 0-12567.
count_floors_pre_eq (type: int): number of floors in the building before the earthquake.
age (type: int): age of the building in years.
area_percentage (type: int): normalized area of the building footprint.
height_percentage (type: int): normalized height of the building footprint.
land_surface_condition (type: categorical): surface condition of the land where the building was built. Possible values: n, o, t.
foundation_type (type: categorical): type of foundation used while building. Possible values: h, i, r, u, w.
roof_type (type: categorical): type of roof used while building. Possible values: n, q, x.

other_floor_type (type: categorical): type of constructions used in higher than the ground floors (except of roof). Possible values: j, q, s, x.
position (type: categorical): position of the building. Possible values: j, o, s, t.
plan_configuration (type: categorical): building plan configuration. Possible values: a, c, d, f, m, n, o, q, s, u.

Each row in the dataset represents a building. The features describe various aspects of each building such as its age, height, number of floors, and materials used for construction. We are tasked to predict the 'damage_grade' of each building which represents the level of damage it sustained during an earthquake. It seems we need to train a prediction model based on the complete_info.csv and then use this model to predict the damage status of the buildings in the incomplete_info.csv.

First, let's inspect the first few lines of the complete_info.csv to better understand the data structure.
