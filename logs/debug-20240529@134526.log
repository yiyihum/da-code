1 represents low damage
2 represents a medium amount of damage
3 represents almost complete destruction

The dataset mainly consists of information on the buildings' structure and their legal ownership. Each row in the dataset represents a specific building in the region that was hit by Gorkha earthquake.

There are 39 columns in this dataset, where the building_id column is a unique and random identifier. The remaining 38 features are described in the section below. Categorical variables have been obfuscated random lowercase ascii characters. The appearance of the same character in distinct columns does not imply the same original value.

Since complete_info.csv likely contains the features and known damage grades, it will be used to train a model. The incomplete_info.csv file contains the buildings for which we need to predict the damage grades. First, I will examine the head of the complete_info.csv file to understand the structure of the data and ensure that it matches the description provided in the README.md.
