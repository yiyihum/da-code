1 represents low damage
2 represents a medium amount of damage
3 represents almost complete destruction

The dataset mainly consists of information on the buildings' structure and their legal ownership. Each row in the dataset represents a specific building in the region that was hit by Gorkha earthquake.

There are 39 columns in this dataset, where the building_id column is a unique and random identifier. The remaining 38 features are described in the section below. Categorical variables have been obfuscated random lowercase ascii characters. The appearance of the same character in distinct columns does not imply the same original value.

The final predictions should be saved to a file named prediction.csv with the columns building_id and damage_grade.

Since this task requires specialized data analysis libraries like pandas, scikit-learn, or a similar machine learning library, and I cannot execute Python code directly in this Bash environment, I will create a Python script to handle the training and prediction. After writing the script, I will execute it to perform the prediction task.
