This means we can apply the same method of counting unique combinations of 'Year', 'Season', and 'City' for games, and 'Year', 'Season', 'City', and 'Event' for events. However, since this type of data analysis is complex and can't be done with simple Bash commands, we should use Python with the Pandas library to process the data.

Let's create a Python script to process both files. The script will read both CSV files, determine the total number of unique 'Games' and 'Events' for each edition of the Summer and Winter Olympics, and then output the results into two new CSV files: 'allGames.csv' and 'allEvents.csv'.

df = pd.concat([summer_df, winter_df])

# Create a new dataframe for the number of Games
games_df = df[['Year', 'Season', 'City']].drop_duplicates()
