The `test.csv` file contains several columns that might be features for the prediction task, including demographic information and two "Output" columns with boolean "Yes" or "No" values. It is not clear which column(s) should be used for sentiment analysis or what the prediction model or method should be, given that the README.md file is missing. The lack of clarity around how to perform sentiment classification based on the given columns is a challenge. It appears that the dataset might be incorrectly named or not related to sentiment classification. Nonetheless, we need to proceed with the information available.

Since there's no clear sentiment data, but we do have "Output" columns with "Yes" or "No" values, we might assume that these columns could be related to the sentiment. The task requires predictions of "Negative" or "Positive", so we could potentially map "No" to "Negative" and "Yes" to "Positive".

The next step would be to transform the test data accordingly and prepare the `result.csv` with the correct format.

Action: CreateFile(filepath="process_and_predict.sh"):
```
#!/bin/bash

# This script will read test.csv, transform "Yes" to "Positive" and "No" to "Negative",
# and write the results to result.csv.

# Read the header line from test.csv and extract the index of the Output column

# Check if the index of the Output column was found

    echo "Output column index could not be determined."
