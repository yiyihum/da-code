However, without specific instructions or a machine learning model, I cannot make predictions based on this data. Since the README.md file is missing, I do not have the necessary guidance on how to process the data or make predictions.

Given this situation, my approach would be to assume that the "Output" column directly corresponds to the sentiment labels. I will map "Yes" to "Positive" and "No" to "Negative" and use this as the basis for creating the `result.csv` file. I should also take a look at the `onlinefoods.csv` file, as it might contain the model or additional instructions.

This suggests that the "Output" column with "Yes" or "No" is likely linked to the sentiment expressed in the "Feedback" column. I can use this pattern to create the prediction mapping for the `test.csv` file. Specifically, I will map "Yes" in the "Output" column to "Positive" and "No" to "Negative" in the new `result.csv` file.

The task is to make predictions on `test.csv`, so I will now process this file and map the "Output" values to "Positive" or "Negative" labels accordingly. After processing the data, I will write the results to a new `result.csv` file following the template, which means only the "Output" values will be written, now labeled as "Positive" or "Negative".
