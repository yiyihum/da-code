When plotting the line chart, you need to filter out records with an average temperature less than -70.

The formula for converting Fahrenheit temperature to Celsius temperature is:

\[ C = (F - 32) \times \frac{5}{9} \]

Where:
- \( C \) is the temperature in Celsius,
- \( F \) is the temperature in Fahrenheit.
