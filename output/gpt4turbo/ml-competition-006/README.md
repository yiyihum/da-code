## Competition

## Evaluation

Submissions are scored based on the quadratic weighted kappa, which measures the agreement between two outcomes. This metric typically varies from 0 (random agreement) to 1 (complete agreement). In the event that there is less agreement than expected by chance, the metric may go below 0.

## Submission File

For each** **`Id` in the test set, you must predict the value for the target** **`quality`. The file should contain a header and have the following format:

```
Id,quality
2056,5
2057,7
2058,3
etc.
```

# Wine Quality Dataset

## About Dataset

### Description:

This datasets is related to red variants of the Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wine.The dataset describes the amount of various chemicals present in wine and their effect on it's quality. The datasets can be viewed as classification or regression tasks. The classes are ordered and not balanced (e.g. there are much more normal wines than excellent or poor ones).Your task is to predict the quality of wine using the given data.

A simple yet challenging project, to anticipate the quality of wine.
The complexity arises due to the fact that the dataset has fewer samples, & is highly imbalanced.
Can you overcome these obstacles & build a good predictive model to classify them?

**This data frame contains the following columns:**

Input variables (based on physicochemical tests):
1 - fixed acidity
2 - volatile acidity
3 - citric acid
4 - residual sugar
5 - chlorides
6 - free sulfur dioxide
7 - total sulfur dioxide
8 - density
9 - pH
10 - sulphates
11 - alcohol
Output variable (based on sensory data):
12 - quality (score between 0 and 10)
