## About Dataset

### Context

This dataset contains tree observations from four areas of the Roosevelt National Forest in Colorado. All observations are cartographic variables (no remote sensing) from 30 meter x 30 meter sections of forest. There are over half a million measurements in total.

### Content

The dataset includes information on tree type, shadow coverage, distance to nearby landmarks (e.g., roads), soil type, and local topography.

### Inspiration

- Can you build a model that predicts what types of trees grow in an area based on the surrounding characteristics? A past Kaggle competition project on this topic can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/forest-cover-type-prediction).
- What kinds of trees are most common in the Roosevelt National Forest?
- Which tree types can grow in more diverse environments? Are there certain tree types that are sensitive to environmental factors, such as elevation or soil type?
