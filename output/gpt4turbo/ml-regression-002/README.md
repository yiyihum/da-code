## About Dataset

### Context

In a paper released early 2019, forecasting in energy markets is highlighted as a significant area where Machine/Deep Learning can contribute to transitioning to a renewable-based electrical infrastructure.

### Content

This dataset spans 4 years and includes electrical consumption, generation, pricing, and weather data for Spain. Consumption and generation data were sourced from the ENTSOE public portal for Transmission Service Operator (TSO) data. Settlement prices were obtained from the Spanish TSO, Red Electric Espa√±a. Weather data for the five largest cities in Spain was acquired from the Open Weather API as part of a personal project and made publicly available.

### Acknowledgements

This data is publicly accessible through ENTSOE and REE via the provided links.

### Inspiration

The dataset offers hourly data on electrical consumption, TSO forecasts for consumption and pricing, enabling benchmarking against industry-leading forecasts:

* Visualize load and marginal supply curves.
* Analyze the impact of weather measurements and cities on electrical demand, prices, and generation capacity.
* Evaluate the ability to forecast 24 hours in advance compared to TSO forecasts.
* Predict electrical prices by time of day more accurately than traditional methods.
* Forecast intraday price fluctuations or hourly electrical demand.
* Identify the next generation source likely to be activated on the load curve.
