## About Dataset

## Delivery Center Overview

Delivery Center, with its various operational hubs across Brazil, integrates retailers and marketplaces, creating a healthy ecosystem for selling goods and food in the Brazilian retail market. The platform manages a catalog of over 900,000 items, with thousands of orders and deliveries processed daily through a network of retailers and delivery partners nationwide.

This generates a vast amount of data constantly. The business is increasingly data-driven, using data to make decisions and envisioning the intelligent use of data as a key market differentiator. This context presents a challenge to apply technical knowledge to solve everyday problems faced by a data team.
