Please Considering ONLY those movies whose number of votes falls within the top 15% !!!

Weighted Rating (wr) Formula : IMDB's weighted rating (wr) is calculated using the formula :
\begin{equation}
Weighted Rating(WR) = \left(\frac{v}{v+m}\cdot R \right) + \left(\frac{m}{v+m} \cdot C \right)
\end{equation}
where,
\begin{enumrate}
\item $v$ : Number of votes for the movie
\item $m$ : Minimum votes required to be listed in the chart, set to the 85th percentile.
\item $R$ : Average rating of the movie
\item $C$ : Mean vote across the dataset
\end{enumrate}
We'll use this formula to calculate a score for each movie, which will help us in recommending movies to users.
Now, let's proceed with the implementation of demographic filtering.
