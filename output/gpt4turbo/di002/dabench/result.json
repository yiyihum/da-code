Higher prices during peak times can help distribute the demand more evenly throughout the day.\n\n2. **Reservation System:** Allow users to reserve charging slots in advance. This can help manage the flow of vehicles and reduce waiting times.\n\n3. **Increased Capacity:** Expand the number of charging points at high-demand locations to accommodate more vehicles simultaneously.\n\n4. **Fast Charging Options:** Offer fast charging stations that can reduce the time needed to charge a vehicle, thus freeing up the station for other users more quickly.\n\n5. **Real-time Information:** Provide a real-time information system that shows the availability of charging stations, helping drivers plan their charging sessions better.\n\n6. **Charging Session Time Limits:** Implement time limits for charging sessions during peak hours to prevent long-duration occupancy of charging points.\n\n7. **Loyalty Programs:** Introduce loyalty programs that reward users for charging during off-peak times or for shorter durations.\n\n8. **Partnerships with Local Businesses:** Collaborate with local businesses to offer incentives for EV drivers to charge during off-peak hours or at less crowded charging stations.\n\n9. **Load Management Systems:** Use smart load management systems to optimize the power distribution among multiple vehicles being charged simultaneously.\n\n10. **Mobile App Integration:** Develop a mobile app that can assist users with finding available charging stations, making reservations, and processing payments.\n\nThese strategies can be tailored and combined based on the specific data and user behavior patterns observed at the charging stations.",

  "system_message": "# CONTEXT #\nYou are a data scientist proficient in analyzing data. You excel at using Bash commands and Python code to solve data-related problems. You are working in a Bash environment with all necessary Python libraries installed. If you need to install additional libraries, you can use the 'pip install' command. You are starting in the /workspace directory, which contains all the data needed for your tasks. You can only use the actions provided in the ACTION SPACE to solve the task. The maximum number of steps you can take is 20.\n\n# ACTION SPACE #\n\n## Bash Action\n* Signature: Bash(code=\"shell_command\")\n* Description: This action string will execute a valid shell command in the `code` field. Only non-interactive commands are supported. Commands like \"vim\" and viewing images directly (e.g., using \"display\") are not allowed.\n* Example: Bash(code=\"ls -l\")\n\n## Python Action\n* Signature: Python(file_path=\"path/to/python_file\"):\n```python\nexecutable_python_code\n```\n* Description: This action will create a python file in the field `file_path` with the content wrapped by paired ``` symbols. If the file already exists, it will be overwritten. After creating the file, the python file will be executed. \n* Example: Python(file_path=\"./hello_world.py\"):\n```python\nprint(\"Hello, world!\")\n```\n\n## SQL Action\n* Signature: SQL(file_path=\"path/to/database_file\", command=\"sql_command\", output=\"path/to/output_file.csv\" or \"direct\")\n* Description: Executes an SQL command on the specified database file. If `output` is set to a file path, the results are saved to this CSV file; if set to 'direct', results are displayed directly.\n* Constraints:\n  - The database file must be accessible and in a format compatible with SQLite (e.g., .sqlite, .db).\n  - SQL commands must be valid and safely formatted to prevent security issues such as SQL injection.\n* Examples:\n  - Example1: SQL(file_path=\"data.sqlite\", command=\"SELECT name FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='table'\", output=\"directly\")\n  - Example2: SQL(file_path=\"data.db\", command=\"SELECT * FROM users\", output=\"users_output.csv\")\n\n## Terminate Action\n* Signature: Terminate(output=\"literal_answer_or_output_path\")\n* Description: This action denotes the completion of the entire task and returns the final answer or the output file/folder path. Make sure the output file is located in the initial workspace directory.\n* Examples:\n  - Example1: Terminate(output=\"New York\")\n  - Example2: Terminate(output=\"result.csv\")\n  - Example3: Terminate(output=\"FAIL\")\n\n\n# NOTICE #\n1. You need to fully understand the action space and its arguments before using it.\n2. You should first understand the environment and conduct data analysis on the given data before handling the task.\n3. You can't take some problems for granted. For example, you should check the existence of files before reading them.\n4. If the function execution fails, you should analyze the error and try to solve it.\n5. For challenging tasks like ML, you may need to verify the correctness of the method by checking the accuracy or other metrics, and try to optimize the method.\n6. Before finishing the task, ensure all instructions are met and verify the existence and correctness of any generated files.\n\n# RESPONSE FROMAT # \nFor each task input, your response should contain:\n1. One analysis of the task and the current environment, reasoning to determine the next action (prefix \"Thought: \").\n2. One action string in the ACTION SPACE (prefix \"Action: \").\n\n# EXAMPLE INTERACTION #\nObservation: ...(the output of last actions, as provided by the environment and the code output, you don't need to generate it)\n\nThought: ...\nAction: ...\n\n# TASK #\nWhat strategies could be implemented at electric vehicle charging stations to better accommodate the high volume of users and long-duration charging sessions observed at popular locations and peak times?\n",
