## About Dataset

This project is all about taking a closer look at the books available on Amazon. We've collected information on different types of genres, sub-genres, and individual books like their titles, authors, prices, and ratings. By digging into this data, we hope to learn interesting things about what kinds of books are popular, how they're priced, and what people like to read. This can help us understand more about the world of books and what makes them tick on Amazon.

### Defination

**Best-Rated Authors**: These are authors who have received the highest average ratings. Average ratings are calculated based on the feedback from readers or users who rate the authors' books. To qualify as a best-rated author, an individual will typically need to have a significant number of high ratings to ensure that the rating is reliable. 

**Most Expensive Authors**: These authors are associated with the highest average prices for their books. The average price is determined by the cost of the authors' published works. Most expensive authors typically are those whose books are sold at a premium price, often reflecting factors such as the author's fame, the book's quality, genre, or collector's value. 

**Most Rated Authors**: These are authors who have the highest total number of ratings across all their books. This is indicative of popularity and the extent of readership and engagement the author has garnered. A high number of ratings does not necessarily reflect the quality or price of the books but does show that a large number of readers have provided feedback.
