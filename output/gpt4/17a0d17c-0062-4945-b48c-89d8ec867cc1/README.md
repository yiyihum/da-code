**About Yulu**
Yulu operates as a prominent micro-mobility service provider in India, offering unique vehicles for daily commuting. Initially focused on alleviating traffic congestion, Yulu provides a safe commuting solution through a mobile app, facilitating shared, solo, and sustainable travel options. Yulu zones are strategically placed at key locations such as metro stations, bus stands, office spaces, residential areas, and corporate offices to ensure convenient and affordable first and last-mile connectivity.

Yulu has recently faced significant revenue declines and has engaged a consulting company to analyze the factors influencing the demand for their shared electric cycles, particularly within the Indian market.

**How to contribute:**

The company seeks answers to the following questions:

- Which variables significantly predict the demand for shared electric cycles in India?
- How effectively do these variables explain variations in electric cycle demand?

**Concepts Utilized:**

- Bi-Variate Analysis
- 2-sample t-test for population differences
- ANOVA
- Chi-square test

**Getting Started:**

Begin by importing the dataset and conducting standard exploratory data analysis procedures, including examining the dataset's structure and characteristics.

Attempt to establish relationships between the dependent variable ("Count") and independent variables such as Workingday, Weather, Season, etc.

Select suitable tests to determine:

- The impact of Working Day on the number of electric cycles rented
- Whether the number of cycles rented varies across different seasons or weather conditions
- The dependency of weather on season (checking between two predictor variables)

Formulate a Null Hypothesis (H0), state an alternate hypothesis (H1), and validate test assumptions (Normality, Equal Variance). You can use tools like histograms, Q-Q plots, or statistical methods such as Levene's test and Shapiro-Wilk test (optional).

Continue with the analysis even if some assumptions fail (e.g., Levene's test or Shapiro-Wilk test), but ensure to verify with visual analysis and provide appropriate reporting.

Define a significance level (alpha), calculate test statistics, make decisions to accept or reject the null hypothesis, and draw conclusions based on the analysis.
